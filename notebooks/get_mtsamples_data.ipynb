The patient was then allowed to awaken and was brought to the recovery room in stable condition.', 'Keywords:': 'ent - otolaryngology, curved allis, tonsillitis, hypertrophied, curettes, tonsillar, adenoid, adenotonsillectomy,'}\n",

OPERATION PERFORMED: Adenotonsillectomy.     ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.     INDICATIONS: The patient is a very nice patient with adenotonsillitis with hypertrophy and obstructive symptoms. Adenotonsillectomy is indicated.     DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position. After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, table was turned and shoulder roll was placed on the shoulders and face was draped in clean fashion. A McIvor mouth gag was applied. The tongue was retracted anteriorly and the McIvor was gently suspended from a Mayo stand. A red rubber Robinson catheter was inserted through the left naris and the soft palate was retracted superiorly. The adenoids were removed with suction electrocautery under mere visualization. The left tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis forceps, retracted medially and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery. The tonsil was removed from the superior and inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in the subcapsular fashion. The right tonsil was grasped in the similar fashion and retracted medially and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery. The tonsil was removed from the superior pole and inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in the subcapsular fashion. The inferior, middle and superior pole vessels were further cauterized with suction electrocautery. Copious saline irrigation of the oral cavity was then performed. There was no further identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure. The estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL. The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. There were no intraoperative complications.', 'Keywords:': 'ent - otolaryngology, hypertrophy, adenotonsillitis, tonsillar pillar, bovie electrocautery, adenotonsillectomy,'}\n",

Two #12-French red rubber Robinson catheters were placed, 1 in each nasal passage, and brought out through the oral cavity and clamped over a dental gauze roll placed on the upper lip to provide soft palate retraction. The nasopharynx was inspected with the laryngeal mirror. Serial passages of the curettes were utilized to remove the nasopharyngeal tissue, following which the nasopharynx was packed with 2 cherry gauze sponges coated in a solution of 0.25% Neo-Synephrine and tannic acid powder.     Attention was then redirected to the oropharynx. The McIvor was reopened, packs removed, and the bleeding was controlled with the suction Bovie unit. The catheters were removed, and the nasal passages and oropharynx were suctioned free of debris. The McIvor was then removed, and the procedure was terminated.     The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.',\n",

The tonsil was freed from anterior pillar and posterior pillar. Amputation occurred along the same plane as the patient's tongue. Suction cautery was then used to allow for hemostasis. The patient's adenoids were then viewed with an adenoid mirror. An adenoid curet was used to remove the patient's adenoid tissue. Specimen sent. Suction cautery was used to allow for hemostasis. Superior pole of left tonsil was then grasped with a curved hemostat. Superior pole was freed using needle tip Bovie dissection. Beginning with 15 desiccate, after superior pole was free, Bovie was switched to 15 fulgurate, and the tonsil was stripped from anterior and posterior pillars.

Tonsils and adenoids were exposed. The patient's right tonsil was first grasped with a curved hemostat. Needle tip cautery was used to free the superior pole of tonsil. The tonsil was then grasped in medial superior aspect with a straight hemostat. The tonsil fascia planes were identified with Bovie dissection along the plane. The tonsil was freed from anterior pillar and posterior pillar. Amputation occurred along the same plane as the patient's tongue. Suction cautery was then used to allow for hemostasis. The patient's adenoids were then viewed with an adenoid mirror. An adenoid curet was used to remove the patient's adenoid tissue. Specimen sent. Suction cautery was used to allow for hemostasis. Superior pole of left tonsil was then grasped with a curved hemostat. Superior pole was freed using needle tip Bovie dissection. Beginning with 15 desiccate, after superior pole was free, Bovie was switched to 15 fulgurate, and the tonsil was stripped from anterior and posterior pillars. The tonsil was then amputated at the same plane as tongue base. Hemostasis was achieved with using suction cautery. Mouth gag was removed. Dual position and occlusion were tested. The patient was extubated and tolerated the procedure well and sent back to PACU.\",\n",
