(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "Yes, I am ready. From analyzing the gold-standard annotation, I've noted several important patterns to apply in future annotations:\n\n1. Granularity of extraction:\n- Break down compound findings into separate labels\n- Include negated findings\n- Capture conditional statements\n- Include treatments mentioned even if not yet administered\n\n2. Context precision:\n- Include complete contextual sentences\n- Maintain exact temporal and conditional relationships\n- Preserve medical terminology precisely\n\n3. Qualifier assignment:\n- Distinguish between signs and symptoms carefully\n- Recognize when the same finding might be both a diagnosis and a sign\n- Properly categorize treatments, including supportive care\n\n4. Metadata accuracy:\n- Track laterality changes throughout the narrative\n- Note temporal stages (pre/post treatment)\n- Distinguish between confirmed/suspected/negated findings\n- Consider the broader clinical context for primary/secondary classification\n\nI am ready to apply these principles to analyze a new clinical letter with this enhanced understanding of the annotation requirements."

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis:\nRight profound mixed sensorineural conductive hearing loss.\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nRight profound mixed sensorineural conductive hearing loss.\n\nProcedure Performed:\nRight middle ear exploration with a Goldenberg TORP reconstruction.\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral\n\nEstimated Blood Loss:\nLess than 5 cc.\n\nComplications:\nNone.\n\nDescription Of Findings:\nThe patient consented to revision surgery because of the profound hearing loss in her right ear. It was unclear from her previous operative records and CT scan as to whether or not she was a reconstruction candidate. She had reports of stapes fixation as well as otosclerosis on her CT scan.     At surgery, she was found to have a mobile malleus handle, but her stapes was fixed by otosclerosis. There was no incus. There was no specific round window niche. There was a very minute crevice; however, exploration of this area did not reveal a niche to a round window membrane. The patient had a type of TORP prosthesis, which had tilted off the footplate anteriorly underneath the malleus handle.\n\nDescription Of The Procedure:\nThe patient was brought to the operative room and placed in supine position. The right face, ear, and neck prepped with ***** alcohol solution. The right ear was draped in the sterile field. External auditory canal was injected with 1% Xylocaine with 1:50,000 epinephrine. A Fisch indwelling incision was made and a tympanomeatal flap was developed in a 12 o'clock to the 7 o'clock position. Meatal skin was elevated, middle ear was entered. This exposure included the oval window, round window areas. There was a good cartilage graft in place and incorporated into the posterior superior ***** of the drum. The previous prosthesis was found out of position as it had tilted out of position anteriorly, and there was no contact with the footplate. The prosthesis was removed without difficulty. The patient's stapes had an arch, but the ***** was atrophied. Malleus handle was mobile. The footplate was fixed. Consideration have been given to performing a stapedectomy with a tissue seal and then returning later for prosthesis insertion; however, upon inspection of the round window area, there was found to be no definable round window niche, no round window membrane. The patient was felt to have obliterated otosclerosis of this area along with the stapes fixation. She is not considered to be a reconstruction candidate under the current circumstances. No attempt was made to remove bone from the round window area. A different style of Goldenberg TORP was placed on the footplate underneath the cartilage support in hopes of transferring some sound conduction from the tympanic membrane to the footplate. The fit was secure and supported with Gelfoam in the middle ear. The tympanomeatal flap was returned to anatomic position supported with Gelfoam saturated Ciprodex. The incision was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and individual #5-0 nylon to the skin, and a sterile dressing was applied.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
