(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "Yes, I am ready. From analyzing the gold-standard annotation, I've noted several important patterns to apply in future annotations:\n\n1. Granularity of extraction:\n- Each distinct clinical concept should be separately annotated, even within the same sentence\n- Negative findings are important and should be captured\n- Both actual conditions and hypothetical/conditional statements should be included\n\n2. Context precision:\n- Include complete sentences that provide full clinical context\n- Maintain exact quotes from the source text\n- Preserve temporal and conditional relationships\n\n3. Qualification accuracy:\n- Careful distinction between signs, symptoms, and diagnoses\n- Treatments include medications, procedures, and interventions\n- Clear differentiation between current and historical findings\n\n4. Metadata completeness:\n- Consistent tracking of laterality when applicable\n- Precise presence status (Confirmed, Negated, Suspected)\n- Appropriate treatment stage classification\n- Careful consideration of experiencer\n\nI am ready to apply these principles to analyze a new clinical letter with this level of detail and precision."

Bilateral conductive hearing losses with right stapedial fixation secondary to otosclerosis.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis:\nBilateral progressive conductive hearing losses with probable otosclerosis.\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nBilateral conductive hearing losses with right stapedial fixation secondary to otosclerosis.\n\nOperation Performed:\nRight argon laser assisted stapedectomy.\n\nDescription Of Operation:\nThe patient was brought to the operating room. Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The patient's right ear was carefully prepped and then draped in the usual sterile fashion. Slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine. The earlobe was also infiltrated with the same solution. A limited incision was made in the earlobe harvesting a small bit of fat from the earlobe that was diced and the donor site closed with interrupted sutures of 5-0 nylon. This could later be removed in bishop. A reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished. A 65 Beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock. Jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation. Elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus. An annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament. The tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain. Palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified. Palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement. A house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani. The nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well. The self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse. The stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured. The fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation. A small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston. The measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire Teflon piston chosen. It was placed in the middle ear atraumatically with a small alligator forceps and was directed towards the fenestration in the footplate. The hook was placed over the incus and measurement appeared to be appropriate. A downbiting crimper was then used to complete the attachment of the prosthesis to the incus. Prosthesis is once again checked for location and centering and appeared to be in ideal position. Small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph. A small pledget of fat was also placed on the top of the incudo-prosthesis junction. The mobility appeared excellent. The flap was placed back in its normal anatomic position. The external canal packed with small pledgets of Gelfoam and antibiotic ointment. She was then awakened and taken to the recovery room in a stable condition with discharge anticipated later this day to Bishop. Sutures will be out in a week and a recheck in Reno in four to five weeks from now.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
