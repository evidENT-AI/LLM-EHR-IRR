(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "Yes, I am ready. From analyzing the gold-standard annotation, I've noted several important patterns to apply in future annotations:\n\n1. Granularity of extraction:\n- Break down compound findings into individual components\n- Capture negated findings explicitly\n- Include conditional/hypothetical mentions with appropriate presence markers\n- Extract both the action and the tools/medications used in treatments\n\n2. Contextual precision:\n- Maintain temporal relationships accurately\n- Preserve exact symptom/sign descriptions\n- Include complete contextual sentences\n- Track laterality carefully when mentioned\n\n3. Classification nuances:\n- Distinguish between signs (objective findings) and symptoms (subjective experiences)\n- Properly categorize treatments, including both medications and procedures\n- Identify diagnostic statements separately from observations\n\n4. Structural consistency:\n- Use array format for multiple labels\n- Include all metadata fields for each entry\n- Maintain consistent formatting for presence/absence indicators\n- Use precise qualifiers for each extraction\n\nI'm ready to apply these principles to analyze a new clinical letter with this improved understanding."

Patient is a 14-year-old white female who presents with her mother complaining of a four-day history of cold symptoms consisting of nasal congestion and left ear pain.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nHistory Of Present Illness:\nPatient is a 14-year-old white female who presents with her mother complaining of a four-day history of cold symptoms consisting of nasal congestion and left ear pain. She has had a dry cough and a fever as high as 100, but this has not been since the first day. She denies any vomiting or diarrhea. She did try some Tylenol Cough and Cold followed by Tylenol Cough and Cold Severe, but she does not think that this has helped.\n\nFamily History:\nThe patient's younger sister has recently had respiratory infection complicated by pneumonia and otitis media.\n\nReview Of Systems:\nThe patient does note some pressure in her sinuses. She denies any skin rash.\n\nSocial History:\nPatient lives with her mother, who is here with her.     Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.\n\nPhysical Examination:\nVITAL SIGNS: Temp is 38.1, pulse is elevated at 101, other vital signs are all within normal limits. Room air oximetry is 100%.   GENERAL: Patient is a healthy-appearing, white female, adolescent who is sitting on the stretcher, and appears only mildly ill.   HEENT: Head is normocephalic, atraumatic. Pharynx shows no erythema, tonsillar edema, or exudate. Both TMs are easily visualized and are clear with good light reflex and no erythema. Sinuses do show some mild tenderness to percussion.   NECK: No meningismus or enlarged anterior/posterior cervical lymph nodes.   HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.   LUNGS: Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.   SKIN: No rash.\n\nAssessment:\nViral upper respiratory infection (URI) with sinus and eustachian congestion.\n\nPlan:\nI did educate the patient about her problem and urged her to switch to Advil Cold & Sinus for the next three to five days for better control of her sinus and eustachian discomfort. I did urge her to use Afrin nasal spray for the next three to five days to further decongest her sinuses. If she is unimproved in five days, follow up with her PCP for re-exam.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
