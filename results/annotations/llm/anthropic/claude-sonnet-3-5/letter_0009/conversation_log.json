(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "Yes, I am ready. From analyzing the gold-standard annotation, I've noted several important patterns to incorporate in future annotations:\n\n1. Granularity of extraction:\n- Break down compound findings into separate labels\n- Include both positive and negative findings\n- Capture medications and treatments separately\n- Include conditional/hypothetical findings\n\n2. Temporal awareness:\n- Distinguish between current and historical findings\n- Note treatment sequences and stages\n- Track symptom progression\n\n3. Contextual precision:\n- Include complete contextual sentences\n- Maintain exact quoted text\n- Preserve medical terminology\n\n4. Comprehensive coverage:\n- Include all treatments (even minor ones like Q-tips)\n- Capture both primary conditions and secondary signs\n- Note both active and preventive treatments\n- Include future care instructions\n\n5. Careful qualification:\n- Distinguish between signs and symptoms\n- Note presence status (Confirmed, Negated, Suspected)\n- Track laterality carefully\n- Mark treatment stages appropriately\n\nI am ready to apply these principles to analyze a new clinical letter with this level of detail and precision."

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis:\nChronic otitis media.\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nChronic otitis media.\n\nProcedure Performed:\nBilateral myringotomy tubes and adenoidectomy.\n\nIndications For Procedure:\nThe patient is an 8-year-old child with history of recurrent otitis media. The patient has had previous tube placement. Tubes have since plugged and are no more functioning. The patient has had recent recurrent otitis media. Risks and benefits in terms of bleeding, anesthesia, and tympanic membrane perforation were discussed with the mother. Mother wished to proceed with the surgery.\n\nProcedure In Detail:\nThe patient was brought to the room, placed supine. The patient was given general endotracheal anesthesia. Starting on the left ear, under microscopic visualization, the ear was cleaned of wax. A Bobbin tube was found stuck to the tympanic membrane. This was removed. After removing the tube the patient was found to have microperforation through which serous fluid was draining. A fresh myringotomy was made in the anterior inferior quadrant. More serous fluid was aspirated from middle ear space. The new Bobbin tube was easily placed. Floxin drops were placed in the ear. In the right ear again under microscopic visualization, the ear was cleaned, the tube was removed off tympanic membrane. There was no perforation seen; however, there was some granulation tissue on the surface of tympanic membrane. A fresh myringotomy incision was made in the anterior inferior quadrant. More serous fluid was drained out of middle ear space. The tube was easily placed and Floxin drops were placed in the ear. This completes tube portion of the surgery. The patient was then turned and placed in the Rose position. Shoulder roll was placed for neck extension. Using a small McIvor mouth gag mouth was held open. Using a rubber catheter the soft palate was retracted. Under mirror visualization, the nasopharynx was examined. The patient was found to have minimal adenoidal tissue. This was removed using a suction Bovie. The patient was then awakened from anesthesia, extubated and brought to recovery room in stable condition. There were no intraoperative complications. Needle and sponge count correct. Estimated blood loss none.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
