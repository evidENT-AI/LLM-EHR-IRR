(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "Yes, I am ready. From analyzing the gold-standard annotation, I've noted several important patterns to incorporate in future annotations:\n\n1. Granularity of extraction:\n- Break down compound findings into separate labels\n- Include both positive and negative findings\n- Capture medications and treatments separately\n- Include hypothetical/conditional symptoms/treatments\n\n2. Temporal awareness:\n- Distinguish between current and historical findings\n- Note treatment sequences (e.g., previous vs. current medications)\n- Track pre- and post-treatment states\n\n3. Contextual precision:\n- Maintain exact phraseology from the text\n- Include complete contextual sentences\n- Preserve medical terminology\n\n4. Comprehensive coverage:\n- Include all treatments (even minor ones like \"Q-tip\" cleaning)\n- Capture both primary conditions and secondary findings\n- Note preventive/conditional treatments\n\n5. Careful qualification:\n- Distinguish between signs, symptoms, and diagnoses\n- Note presence status (Confirmed, Negated, Suspected)\n- Track laterality carefully\n\nI'm ready to apply these principles to analyze a new clinical letter with this level of detail and precision."

Adenotonsillitis with hypertrophy. The patient is a very nice patient with adenotonsillitis with hypertrophy and obstructive symptoms. Adenotonsillectomy is indicated.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report) PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Adenotonsillitis with hypertrophy.     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Adenotonsillitis with hypertrophy.     OPERATION PERFORMED: Adenotonsillectomy.     ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.     INDICATIONS: The patient is a very nice patient with adenotonsillitis with hypertrophy and obstructive symptoms. Adenotonsillectomy is indicated.     DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position. After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, table was turned and shoulder roll was placed on the shoulders and face was draped in clean fashion. A McIvor mouth gag was applied. The tongue was retracted anteriorly and the McIvor was gently suspended from a Mayo stand. A red rubber Robinson catheter was inserted through the left naris and the soft palate was retracted superiorly. The adenoids were removed with suction electrocautery under mere visualization. The left tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis forceps, retracted medially and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery. The tonsil was removed from the superior and inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in the subcapsular fashion. The right tonsil was grasped in the similar fashion and retracted medially and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery. The tonsil was removed from the superior pole and inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in the subcapsular fashion. The inferior, middle and superior pole vessels were further cauterized with suction electrocautery. Copious saline irrigation of the oral cavity was then performed. There was no further identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure. The estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL. The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. There were no intraoperative complications.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
