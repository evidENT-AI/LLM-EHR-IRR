Individuals may be unable to speak, learn to walk later or may never walk. In infancy hypotonia and feeding difficulties may be present along with dysphagia, hypersomnolence, hypothermia and hypoventilation. Recurrent seizures are common. Caused by mutations in the PURA gene, which provides instructions for the protein Pur-alpha. This protein has multiple roles in cells, including gene transcription and replication of DNA. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, however most cases result from de novo mutation.",
