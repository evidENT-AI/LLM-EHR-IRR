(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "Yes, I am ready. From analyzing the gold-standard annotation, I've noted several important patterns to apply in future annotations:\n\n1. Granularity of extraction:\n- Break down compound findings into separate labels\n- Include negated findings\n- Capture conditional statements\n- Include treatments mentioned even if not administered\n\n2. Context precision:\n- Include complete contextual sentences\n- Maintain exact temporal and conditional relationships\n- Preserve medication dosing information when available\n\n3. Qualifier accuracy:\n- Distinguish between signs and symptoms carefully\n- Properly categorize treatments vs. procedures\n- Recognize diagnostic statements vs. clinical findings\n\n4. Metadata completeness:\n- Track laterality consistently\n- Use \"Negated\" presence appropriately\n- Consider treatment staging carefully\n- Mark temporal relationships accurately\n\n5. Structure:\n- Use array of objects rather than nested objects\n- Include all fields for every entry\n- Maintain consistent formatting\n- Use exact text quotes\n\nI'm ready to apply these principles to analyze a new clinical letter with this improved understanding."

A curved hemostat was used to grasp the lingual frenulum. The stat was removed and Metzenbaum scissors were used to free the lingual frenulum. Cautery was used to allow hemostasis. The patient was then turned. McIvor mouth gag was inserted. Tonsils and adenoids were exposed. The patient's right tonsil was first grasped with a curved hemostat. Needle tip cautery was used to free the superior pole of tonsil. The tonsil was then grasped in medial superior aspect with a straight hemostat. The tonsil fascia planes were identified with Bovie dissection along the plane. The tonsil was freed from anterior pillar and posterior pillar. Amputation occurred along the same plane as the patient's tongue. Suction cautery was then used to allow for hemostasis. The patient's adenoids were then viewed with an adenoid mirror. An adenoid curet was used to remove the patient's adenoid tissue. Specimen sent. Suction cautery was used to allow for hemostasis. Superior pole of left tonsil was then grasped with a curved hemostat. Superior pole was freed using needle tip Bovie dissection. Beginning with 15 desiccate, after superior pole was free, Bovie was switched to 15 fulgurate, and the tonsil was stripped from anterior and posterior pillars. The tonsil was then amputated at the same plane as tongue base. Hemostasis was achieved with using suction cautery. Mouth gag was removed. Dual position and occlusion were tested. The patient was extubated and tolerated the procedure well and sent back to PACU.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
