(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "Yes, I am ready. From analyzing the gold-standard annotation, I've noted several important patterns to apply in future annotations:\n\n1. Granularity of extraction:\n- Break down compound findings into individual components\n- Capture negated findings explicitly\n- Include conditional/hypothetical findings with appropriate presence markers\n\n2. Contextual precision:\n- Maintain exact phraseology from the source text\n- Include complete contextual sentences\n- Preserve temporal and conditional relationships\n\n3. Qualification accuracy:\n- Distinguish between signs, symptoms, and diagnoses carefully\n- Track treatment stages accurately\n- Note when findings are resolved vs. active\n\n4. Structural completeness:\n- Include all relevant treatments, including supportive care\n- Capture both primary and secondary findings\n- Document preventive/conditional treatments\n\n5. Metadata consistency:\n- Use appropriate presence markers (Confirmed, Negated, NA)\n- Track laterality carefully\n- Maintain consistent experiencer attribution\n\nI am ready to apply these principles to analyze a new clinical letter with this improved understanding of the annotation requirements."

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nOtitis Media:\nis an infection of the middle ear space where the small bones and nerves of the ear connect to the eardrum on one side and the eustachian tube on the other. The ear infection itself is not contagious but the respiratory infection preceding it is transmittable. Otitis media is most often seen in infants and young children. There are several causes including a viral or bacterial infection that spreads to the middle ear by way of the eustachian tubes, nasal allergy drainage blocking the sinuses or eustachian tubes, enlarged adenoids also blocking sinuses or eustachian tubes and eardrum rupture. Many factors can increase the risk of an ear infection like recent upper respiratory tract illness, crowded living conditions, family history of ear infections, day care, smoking in household, altitude changes, cold weather and genetic factors.\n\nSigns And Symptoms:\n* Irritability.   * Ear pain, fullness, hearing loss.   * Infants may pull on ear.   * Fever.   * Vomiting.   * Discharge from ear.   * Diarrhea.\n\nTreatment:\n* Diagnosis is by physical exam and otoscopic exam. Sometimes fluid from the ear is cultured.   * Pain relievers, like acetaminophen (Tylenol). Infant pain relievers are available.   * Decongestant to relieve symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection.   * Antibiotics when indicated for bacterial infection such as Amoxicillin or Zithromycin. Finish ALL antibiotics as prescribed. Do not stop the medication even if symptoms subside.   * Avoid swimming until infection goes away.   * Surgery is sometimes necessary to put in tubes through the eardrum to equalize pressure and drain fluids.   * Surgery to remove adenoids if they are enlarged.   * Reduce activity until symptoms subside.     Call doctor's office if symptoms do not improve within 2 days of treatment, and for convulsion, fever, ear swelling, dizziness, twitching facial muscles and severe headache.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
