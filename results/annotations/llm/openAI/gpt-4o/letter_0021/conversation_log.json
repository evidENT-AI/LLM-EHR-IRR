(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

Examination under anesthesia with control of right parapharyngeal space hemorrhage. The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of a chronic pharyngitis and obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis:\nPostoperative hemorrhage.\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nPostoperative hemorrhage.\n\nSurgical Procedure:\nExamination under anesthesia with control of right parapharyngeal space hemorrhage.\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral endotracheal technique.\n\nSurgical Findings:\nRight lower pole bleeder cauterized with electrocautery with good hemostasis.\n\nIndications For Surgery:\nThe patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of a chronic pharyngitis and obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Previously, in the day she had undergone a tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy and was recovering without difficulty. However, in the PACU after a coughing spell she began bleeding from the right oropharynx, and was taken back to the operative suite for control of hemorrhage.\n\nDescription Of Surgery:\nThe patient was placed supine on the operating room table and general anesthetic was administered, once appropriate anesthetic findings achieved the patient was intubated and then prepped and draped in usual sterile manner for a parapharyngeal space hemorrhage. A Crowe-Davis type mouth gag was introduced in the oropharynx and under operating headlight the oropharynx was clearly visualized. There was a small bleeder present at the inferior mid pole of the right oropharynx in the tonsillar fossa, this area was cauterized with suction cautery and irrigated. There was no other bleeding noted. The patient was repositioned and the mouth gag, the tongue was rotated to the left side of the mouth and the right parapharyngeal space carefully examined. There was a small amount of oozing noted in the right tonsillar bed, and this was cauterized with suction cautery. No other bleeding was noted and the patient was recovered from general anesthetic. She was extubated and left the operating room in good condition to postoperative recovery room area. Prior to extubation the patient's tonsillar fossa were injected with a 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine with 1:100,000 adrenalin solution to facilitate postoperative analgesia and hemostasis.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
