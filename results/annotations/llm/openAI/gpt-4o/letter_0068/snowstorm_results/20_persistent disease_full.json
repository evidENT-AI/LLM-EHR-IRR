Additional characteristics include growth retardation, joint stiffness (mainly of fingers, hands, knees, and elbows), wide cranial sutures, dysmorphic facial features (prominent eyes, convex nasal ridge, malocclusion, dental crowding, thin lip vermillion, microretrognathia) and persistent eyebrows, eyelashes and scalp hair. There is evidence the disease is caused by homozygous mutation in the BANF1 gene on chromosome 11q13.",
