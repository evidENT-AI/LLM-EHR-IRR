1% xylocaine with epinephrine,slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% xylocaine with epinephrine.,treatments,right,confirmed,primary,patient,pre-treatment,
5-0 nylon,this could later be removed in bishop. a reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished. a 65 beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock. jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation. elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus. an annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament. the tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain.,treatments,,confirmed,,patient,post-treatment,
good mobility,"palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified.",signs,,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,

chorda tympani,the nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well.,,,,,patient,,
fenestration,the fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation.,signs,,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,
teflon piston,a small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston. the measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire teflon piston chosen.,treatments,,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,
