  "indications for surgery": "The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of a chronic pharyngitis and obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Previously, in the day she had undergone a tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy and was recovering without difficulty.

A Crowe-Davis type mouth gag was introduced in the oropharynx and under operating headlight the oropharynx was clearly visualized. There was a small bleeder present at the inferior mid pole of the right oropharynx in the tonsillar fossa, this area was cauterized with suction cautery and irrigated. There was no other bleeding noted. The patient was repositioned and the mouth gag, the tongue was rotated to the left side of the mouth and the right parapharyngeal space carefully examined. There was a small amount of oozing noted in the right tonsillar bed, and this was cauterized with suction cautery. No other bleeding was noted and the patient was recovered from general anesthetic.
