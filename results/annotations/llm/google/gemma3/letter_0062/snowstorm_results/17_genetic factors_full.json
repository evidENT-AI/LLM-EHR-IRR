The episodes can last for several days and occur weeks to months apart, manifestations include erythematous plaques on the skin, abdominal pain, dry eyes, dry mouth, mouth sores, chest pain and gland enlargement. This condition likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Variations in the NOD2 gene increase risk and it is suspected that environmental factors such as infections may also play a role in triggering the disease in people with genetic variants that increase their risk. The syndrome appears to be a complex disease without a single genetic cause.",

      "term": "A rare inherited form of cutaneous melanoma with characteristics of development of histologically confirmed melanoma in two first degrees relatives or more relatives in an affected family. It is thought to account for about 10% of all cases of cutaneous melanoma. Tends to occur earlier than non-familial melanoma. The risk of familial melanoma is closely related to a wide range of genetic alterations in susceptibility genes but also appears to be influenced by phenotypic risk factors, such as pigmentation, freckling and sun reactions. Complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors are therefore thought to underlie the disease. The most common high-penetrance susceptibility gene implicated is CDKN2A, accounting for predisposition in approximately 20% of cases. In some affected families, susceptibility is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance but in most cases, a polygenic mode of inheritance appears likely.",
