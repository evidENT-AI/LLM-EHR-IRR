(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

Tympanostomy and tube placement and adenoidectomy.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis:\nAdenotonsillar hypertrophy and chronic otitis media.\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nAdenotonsillar hypertrophy and chronic otitis media.\n\nProcedure Performed:\n1. Tympanostomy and tube placement.   2. Adenoidectomy.\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral endotracheal.\n\nDescription Of Procedure:\nThe patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the usual fashion. After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the McIvor mouth gag was placed in the oral cavity and a tongue depressor applied. Two #12-French red rubber Robinson catheters were placed, 1 in each nasal passage, and brought out through the oral cavity and clamped over a dental gauze roll placed on the upper lip to provide soft palate retraction.     Attention was directed to the nasopharynx. With the Bovie set at 50 coag and the suction Bovie tip on the suction hose, the adenoid bed was fulgurated by beginning at the posterosuperior aspect of the nasopharynx at the apex of the choana placing the tip of the suction cautery deep at the root of the adenoids next to the roof of the nasopharynx and then in a linear fashion making serial passages through the base of the adenoid fossa in parallel lines until the entire nasopharynx and adenoid bed had been fulgurated moving from posterior to anterior. The McIvor was relaxed and attention was then directed to the ears.     The left external auditory canal was examined under the operating microscope and cleaned of ceruminous debris.     An anteroinferior quadrant tympanostomy incision was made. Fluid was suctioned from the middle ear space, and a tympanostomy tube was placed at the level of the incision and pushed into position with the Rosen needle. Cortisporin ear drops were instilled into the canal, and a cotton ball was placed in the external meatus.     By a similar procedure, the opposite tympanostomy and tube placement were accomplished.     The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
