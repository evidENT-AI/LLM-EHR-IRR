      "term": "Syndrome with characteristics of diffuse cartilage calcification, brachytelephalangism, peripheral pulmonary artery stenoses and facial dysmorphism. The abnormal calcification principally involves the cartilage of the ears, nose, larynx and the tracheobronchial tree. Epiphyseal stippling of the long bones and calcification of the spinal column vertebrae have also been reported. The dysmorphism is characterized by an elongated face with maxillary and midface hypoplasia. Other associated features may include hearing loss and recurrent otitis and/or sinusitis, mild intellectual deficit, frequent respiratory infections, nasal speech and, more rarely, seizures and short stature. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the matrix Gla protein (MGP, located at 12p13.1-p12.3). The syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait.",
