erythema,"there was also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted. these were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus. eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that. the chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract. a second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity. therefore the chest was opened and remarkably findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout. remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe. there were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it. there was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe. the adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.",signs,,confirmed,secondary,patient,post-treatment,247441003

cavity,"there seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed. many cultures were taken from several areas. the most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.",diagnoses,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,46984003
