Patients usually present with eosinophilia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, fever, sweating and/or weight loss. Tissue infiltration by eosinophils can manifest with skin rash, erythema, cough, neurological alterations, gastrointestinal symptoms or, rarely, endomyocardial fibrosis and restrictive cardiomyopathy.",

It is extremely rare with four individuals in one family identified to date. Development is reported to be normal in affected patients. Clinical signs include lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, and development of recurrent sinopulmonary and significant mucocutaneous infections with the Herpes zoster and Herpes simplex viruses. The disorder is caused by germline homozygous mutations in the CASP8 gene (2q33-q34) involved in the execution phase of cell apoptosis. Carriers with a normal copy of the gene are asymptomatic. Biologically this syndrome has manifestations of slightly elevated double-negative T cells (DNTs) and defective Fas-mediated apoptosis of B, T, and NK lymphocytes. The pattern of inheritance appears to be autosomal recessive.",
