      "term": "A rare renal disease characterised by thrombotic microangiopathy developing de novo in kidney transplant recipients with no evidence of occurrence of the disease prior to transplantation. Precipitating factors include antibody-mediated rejection, immunosuppressive medication, viral infections and genetic abnormalities in the complement cascade, among others. The condition most commonly occurs within the first 3-6 months post-transplantation. Clinical presentation is highly variable and ranges from a limited form confined to the kidney with relatively good prognosis to a systemic variant consisting of the classic triad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and acute kidney injury.",
