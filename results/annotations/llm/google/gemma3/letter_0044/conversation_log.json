(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

The patient is an 11-year-old male who was admitted from the ER after a CT scan suggested that the child had mastoiditis.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nDischarge Diagnoses:\n1. Suspected mastoiditis ruled out.   2. Right acute otitis media.   3. Severe ear pain resolving.\n\nHistory Of Present Illness:\nThe patient is an 11-year-old male who was admitted from the ER after a CT scan suggested that the child had mastoiditis. The child has had very severe ear pain and blood draining from the right ear. The child had a temperature maximum of 101.4 in the ER. The patient was admitted and started on IV Unasyn, which he tolerated well and required Morphine and Vicodin for pain control. In the first 12 hours after admission, the patient's pain decreased and also swelling of his cervical area decreased. The patient was evaluated by Dr. X from the ENT while in house. After reviewing the CT scan, it was felt that the CT scan was not consistent with mastoiditis. The child was continued on IV fluid and narcotics for pain as well as Unasyn until the time of discharge. At the time of discharge his pain is markedly decreased about 2/10 and swelling in the area has improved. The patient is also able to take p.o. well.\n\nDischarge Physical Examination:\nGENERAL: The patient is alert, in no respiratory distress.   VITAL SIGNS: His temperature is 97.6, heart rate 83, blood pressure 105/57, respiratory rate 16 on room air.   HEENT: Right ear shows no redness. The area behind his ear is nontender. There is a large posterior chains node that is nontender and the swelling in this area has decreased markedly.   NECK: Supple.   CHEST: Clear breath sounds.   CARDIAC: Normal S1, S2 without murmur.   ABDOMEN: Soft. There is no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.   SKIN: Warm and well perfused.\n\nDischarge Weight:\n38.7 kg.\n\nDischarge Condition:\nGood.\n\nDischarge Diet:\nRegular as tolerated.\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. Ciprodex Otic Solution in the right ear twice daily.   2. Augmentin 500 mg three times daily x10 days.\n\nFollow Up:\n1. Dr. Y in one week (ENT).   2. The primary care physician in 2 to 3 days.\n\nTime Spent:\nApproximate discharge time is 28 minutes.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
