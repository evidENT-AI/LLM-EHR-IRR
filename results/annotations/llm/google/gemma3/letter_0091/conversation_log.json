(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure and multiple strokes.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnoses:\n1. Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.   2. Multiple strokes.\n\nPostoperative Diagnoses:\n1. Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.   2. Multiple strokes.\n\nProcedures Performed:\n1. Tracheostomy.   2. Thyroid isthmusectomy.\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral endotracheal tube.\n\nBlood Loss:\nMinimal, less than 25 cc.\n\nIndications:\nThe patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who presented to the Emergency Department who had had multiple massive strokes. He had required ventilator assistance and was transported to the ICU setting. Because of the numerous deficits from the stroke, he is expected to have a prolonged ventilatory course and he will be requiring long-term care.\n\nProcedure:\nAfter all risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with multiple family members in detail, informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought to the Operative Suite where he was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered through the existing endotracheal tube. The neck was then palpated and marked appropriately in the cricoid cartilage sternal notch and thyroid cartilage marked appropriately with felt-tip marker. The skin was then anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine solution. The patient was prepped and draped in usual fashion. The surgeons were gowned and gloved. A vertical skin incision was then made with a #15 blade scalpel extending from approximately two fingerbreadths above the level of the sternum approximately 1 cm above the cricoid cartilage. Blunt dissection was then carried down until the fascia overlying the strap muscles were identified. At this point, the midline raphe was identified and the strap muscles were separated utilizing the Bovie cautery. Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration. A high-riding innominate was not identified. At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized. Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery. Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion. This cleared a significant portion of the trachea. The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery. Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea. The second tracheal ring was identified. The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based. At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff. The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created. The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified. At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen. The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached. He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist. Now, all surgical retractors were removed. The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture. The tube was further secured around the patient's neck with IV tubing. Finally, a drain sponge was placed. At this point, procedure was felt to be complete. The patient was returned to the ICU setting in stable condition where a chest x-ray is pending.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
