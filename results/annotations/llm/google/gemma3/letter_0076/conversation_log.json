(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

Excision of right upper lid skin lesion 1 cm in diameter with adjacent tissue transfer closure.\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral endotracheal.\n\nEstimated Blood Loss:\nLess than 30 cc.\n\nComplications:\nNone.\n\nIndications For Procedure:\nThe patient is a 51-year-old Caucasian female with a history of a nasopharyngeal mass discovered with patient's chief complaint of nasal congestion and chronic ear disease. The patient had a fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy performed in the office which demonstrated the mass and confirmed also on CT scan. The patient also has had this right upper lid skin lesion which appears to be a cholesterol granuloma for numerous months. It appears to be growing in size and is irregularly bordered. After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed to the patient, a written consent was obtained for the procedure.\n\nProcedure:\nThe patient was brought to the operating suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operating table in supine position. After this, the patient was turned to 90 degrees by the Department of Anesthesia. The right upper eyelid skin lesion was injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 1 cc total. After this, the patient's bilateral nasal passages were then packed with cocaine-soaked cottonoids of 10% solution of 4 cc total. The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and the right upper lid skin was then first cut around the skin lesion utilizing a Superblade. After this, the skin lesion was then grasped with a ________ in the superior aspect and the skin lesion was cut and removed in the subcutaneous plane utilizing Westcott scissors. After this, the ________ was then hemostatically controlled with monopolar cauterization. The patient's skin was then reapproximated with a running #6-0 Prolene suture. A Mastisol along with a single Steri-Strip was in place followed Maxitrol ointment. Attention then was drawn to the nasopharynx. The cocaine-soaked cottonoids were removed from the nasal passages bilaterally and zero-degree otoscope was placed all the way to the patient's nasopharynx. The patient had a severely deviated nasal septum more so to the right than the left. There appeared to be a spur on the left inferior aspect and also on the right posterior aspect. The nasopharyngeal mass appeared polypoid in nature almost lymphoid tissue looking. It was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 of approximately 3 cc total. After this, the lesion was then removed on the right side with the XPS blade. The torus tubarius was noted on the left side with the polypoid lymphoid tissue involving this area completely. This area was taken down with the XPS blade. Prior to taking down this lesion with the XPS, multiple biopsies were taken with a straight biter. After this, a cocaine-soaked cottonoid was placed back in the patient's left nasal passage region and the nasopharynx and the attention was then drawn to the right side. The zero-degree otoscope was placed in the patient's right nasal passage and all the way to the nasopharynx. Again, the XPS was then utilized to take down the nasopharyngeal mass in its entirety with some involvement overlying the torus tubarius. After this, the patient was then hemostatically controlled with suctioned Bovie cauterization. A FloSeal was then placed followed by bilateral Merocels and bacitracin-coated ointment. The patient's Meroceles were then tied together to the patient's forehead and the patient was then turned back to the Anesthesia. The patient was extubated in the operating room and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent home and with instructions to followup approximately in one week. The patient will be sent home with a prescription for Keflex 500 mg one p.o. b.i.d, and Tylenol #3 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. pain #30.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
