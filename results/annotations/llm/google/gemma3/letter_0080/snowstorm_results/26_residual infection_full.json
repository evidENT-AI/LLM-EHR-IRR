During the second phase (variable duration), symptoms become stable but other manifestations (cardiac arrhythmias, hyper/hypotension and gastric dysmotility) may occur. During the third (recovery) phase, lasting a few months or longer, symptoms slowly regress. Many patients have residual findings (weakness, sensory disturbances, fatigue or pain) for many months or even years.
