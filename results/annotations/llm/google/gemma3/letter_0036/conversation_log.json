(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nChief Complaint:\nSevere tonsillitis, palatal cellulitis, and inability to swallow.\n\nHistory Of Present Illness:\nThis patient started having sore throat approximately one week ago; however, yesterday it became much worse. He was unable to swallow. He complained to his parent. He was taken to Med Care and did not get any better, and therefore presented this morning to ER, where seen and evaluated by Dr. X and concerned as whether he had an abscess either pharyngeal, palatal, or peritonsillar. He was noted to have extreme tonsillitis with kissing tonsils, marked exudates especially right side and right palatal cellulitis. A CT scan at ER did not show abscess. He has not had airway compromise, but he has had difficulty swallowing. He may have had a low-grade fever, but nothing marked at home. His records from Hospital are reviewed as well as the pediatric notes by Dr. X. He did have some equivalent leukocytosis. He had a negative monospot and negative strep screen.\n\nPast Medical History:\nThe patient takes no medications, has had no illnesses or surgeries and he is generally in good health other than being significantly overweight. He is a sophomore at High School.\n\nFamily History:\nNoncontributory to this illness.\n\nSurgeries:\nNone.\n\nHabits:\nNonsmoker, nondrinker. Denies illicit drug use.\n\nReview Of Systems:\nENT: The patient other than having dysphagia, the patient denies other associated ENT symptomatology.   GU: Denies dysuria.   Orthopedic: Denies joint pain, difficulty walking, etc.   Neuro: Denies headache, blurry vision, etc.   Eyes: Says vision is intact.   Lungs: Denies shortness of breath, cough, etc.   Skin: He states he has a rash, which occurred from penicillin that he was given IM yesterday at Covington Med Care. Mildly itchy. Mother has penicillin allergy.   Endocrine: The patient denies any weight loss, weight gain, skin changes, fatigue, etc, essentially no symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism.   Physical Exam:   General: This is a morbidly obese white male adolescent, in no acute disease, alert and oriented x 4. Voice is normal. He is handling his secretions. There is no stridor.   Vital Signs: See vital signs in nurses notes.   Ears: TM and EACs are normal. External, normal.   Nose: Opening clear. External nose is normal.   Mouth: Has bilateral marked exudates, tonsillitis, right greater than left. Uvula is midline. Tonsils are touching. There is some redness of the right palatal area, but is not consistent with peritonsillar abscess. Tongue is normal. Dentition intact. No mucosal lesions other than as noted.   Neck: No thyromegaly, masses, or adenopathy except for some small minimally enlarged high jugular nodes.   Chest: Clear to auscultation.   Heart: No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.   Abdomen: Obese. Complete exam deferred.   Skin: Visualized skin dry and intact, except for rash on his inner thighs and upper legs, which is red maculopapular and consistent with possible allergic reaction.   Neuro: Cranial nerves II through XII are intact. Eyes, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, full range.\n\nImpression:\nMarked exudative tonsillitis, non-strep, non-mono, probably mixed anaerobic infection. No significant prior history of tonsillitis. Possible rash to PENICILLIN.\n\nRecommendations:\nI concur with IV clindamycin and IV Solu-Medrol as per Dr. X. I anticipate this patient may need several days of IV antibiotics and then be able to switch over to oral. I do not insist that this patient will need surgical intervention since there is no evidence of abscess. This one episode of severe tonsillitis does not mean the patient needs tonsillectomy, but if he continues to have significant tonsil problems after this he should be referred for ENT evaluation as an outpatient. The patient's parents in the room had expressed good understanding, have a chance to ask questions. At this time, I will see the patient back on an as needed basis.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
