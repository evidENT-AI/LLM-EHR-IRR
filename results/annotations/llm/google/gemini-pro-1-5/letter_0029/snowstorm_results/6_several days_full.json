Variable cardiac malformations were also reported. Although there were autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS)-like biological features, clinical ALPS was not present. A homozygous missense mutation in the FADD gene (11q13.3) was found in the family and the disease is thought to follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.",

The episodes can last for several days and occur weeks to months apart, manifestations include erythematous plaques on the skin, abdominal pain, dry eyes, dry mouth, mouth sores, chest pain and gland enlargement. This condition likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Variations in the NOD2 gene increase risk and it is suspected that environmental factors such as infections may also play a role in triggering the disease in people with genetic variants that increase their risk. The syndrome appears to be a complex disease without a single genetic cause.",

Individuals may have frequent seizures over a few days or weeks and then several months before subsequent seizure.

Seizures may evolve rapidly to tonic-clonic activity of the ipsilateral upper limb, to an ipsilateral hemiclonic seizure, or to a focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure. Todd paresis may occur postictally. Seizures occurring during sleep are seen within one hour of falling asleep or one to two hours prior to awakening. Development and cognition are typically normal. Neurological examination is normal. The electroencephalogram (EEG) background activity is normal. EEG must show centrotemporal biphasic epileptiform discharges which are characteristically high-amplitude complexes (less than 200 microvolts, peak to trough) that activate in drowsiness and sleep.
