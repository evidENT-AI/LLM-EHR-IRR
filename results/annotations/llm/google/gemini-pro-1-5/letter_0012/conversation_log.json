(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nDiagnosis:\nT1 N3 M0 cancer of the nasopharynx, status post radiation therapy with 2 cycles of high dose cisplatin with radiation, completed June, 2006; status post 2 cycles carboplatin/5-FU given as adjuvant therapy, completed September, 2006; hearing loss related to chemotherapy and radiation; xerostomia; history of left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.\n\nPerformance Status:\n0.\n\nInterval History:\nIn the interim since his last visit he has done quite well. He is working. He did have an episode of upper respiratory infection and fever at the end of April which got better with antibiotics. Overall when he compares his strength to six or eight months ago he notes that he feels much stronger. He has no complaints other than mild xerostomia and treatment related hearing loss.\n\nPhysical Examination:\nVital Signs: Height 65 inches, weight 150, pulse 76, blood pressure 112/74, temperature 95.4, respirations 18.   HEENT: Extraocular muscles intact. Sclerae not icteric. Oral cavity free of exudate or ulceration. Dry mouth noted.   Lymph: No palpable adenopathy in cervical, supraclavicular or axillary areas.   Lungs: Clear.   Cardiac: Rhythm regular.   Abdomen: Soft, nondistended. Neither liver, spleen, nor other masses palpable.   Lower Extremities: Without edema.   Neurologic: Awake, alert, ambulatory, oriented, cognitively intact.     I reviewed the CT images and report of the study done on May 1. This showed no evidence of metabolically active malignancy.     Most recent laboratory studies were performed last September and the TSH was normal. I have asked him to repeat the TSH at the one year anniversary.     He is on no current medications.     In summary, this 57-year-old man presented with T1 N3 cancer of the nasopharynx and is now at 20 months post completion of all therapy. He has made a good recovery. We will continue to follow thyroid function and I have asked him to obtain a TSH at the one year anniversary in September and CBC in follow up. We will see him in six months' time with a PET-CT.     He returns to the general care and direction of Dr. ABC.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
