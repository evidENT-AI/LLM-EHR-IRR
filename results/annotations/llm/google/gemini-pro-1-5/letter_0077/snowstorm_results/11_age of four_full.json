Dysmorphic features include frontal bossing, almond-shaped eyes, long eyelashes, depressed nasal bridge, and large, posteriorly rotated ears. Renal lithiasis occurs at an early age in all patients. Reduced activity of the respiratory chain complexes I, III, IV and V was found in patients examined. The syndrome is caused by homozygous deletion of at least four contiguous genes on chromosome 2: SLC3A1, PREPL, PPM1B and C2orf34 (2p21).",

      "term": "A very rare syndrome that presents with short and sparse scalp hair from birth or the first months of life with no subsequent growth during life. During the first to third decades of life, visual acuity decreases because of progressive macular degeneration, leading in many cases to blindness between the second and fourth decades of life. The hair phenotype does not improve significantly with age, even though diffuse alopecia in infancy can evolve towards short and sparse hair in puberty. Caused by mutations in the CDH3 gene (16q22.1), encoding P-cadherin. P-cadherin is part of adherens junctions in various epithelia including the hair follicular epithelium. Inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.",

It has been described in four patients: two sisters and their female cousin belonging to a consanguineous Pakistani family, and one unrelated case (also born to consanguineous parents). Patients also present with facial dysmorphism (a triangular face, small chin, low set ears), flexion contractures of the arms and legs, very little subcutaneous fat and optic nerve hypoplasia. One of the patients had pancreatic agenesis and the others were suspected of having pancreatic hypoplasia. The syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder. It is caused by mutations in the PTF1A gene (10p12.3). Prenatal diagnosis is possible by demonstration of the absence of the cerebellum and severe intra-uterine growth retardation. All patients died in the neonatal period.",
