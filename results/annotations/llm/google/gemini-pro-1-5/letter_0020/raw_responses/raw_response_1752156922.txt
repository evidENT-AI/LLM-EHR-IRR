Yes, I am ready for the next letter.  I have reviewed the gold-standard annotation and noted the following for improvement in my future analyses:

* **Experiencer Field:** I used "experiencer" instead of "experienced." I will correct this in future annotations.
* **Qualifier Consistency:** I need to be more precise with qualifiers (e.g., using "symptoms" for cold and ear discharge, as opposed to "diagnoses", and "signs" where appropriate).
* **Signs vs. Symptoms:** I need to differentiate more carefully between signs (observable by clinician) and symptoms (reported by patient).  
* **Negated Symptoms:**  I missed capturing negated symptoms, such as "does not hurt."
* **SNOMED CT Codes:** My SNOMED CT codes were sometimes incorrect or missing. I will prioritize accuracy and completeness for these codes moving forward.
* **Context Specificity:** The context provided should be as specific as possible while still providing enough information to understand the label (for example, including all modifiers like "reddened bulging drum")
* **Presence Field Usage:** Using "NA" when presence cannot be confirmed or negated (like hypothetical "ear drainage").
* **"Labels" as array:** The "labels" field should be an array, not a key-value object.
* **Label as text:** Instead of the label being the key for a dictionary entry, the label text must be in a field "text".

I will apply these learnings to the next clinical letter.
