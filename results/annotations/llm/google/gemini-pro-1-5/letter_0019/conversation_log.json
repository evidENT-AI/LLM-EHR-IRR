(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

I have reviewed the gold-standard annotation and will incorporate the following improvements in my future analyses:\n\n* **Consistent use of lowercase for qualifiers:**  I will use \"symptoms\", \"signs\", \"diagnoses\", \"treatment\", etc.\n* **More precise SNOMED CT codes where possible:** I will strive to use the most specific codes available.\n* **Careful consideration of presence:** Paying close attention to negated findings (\"no\", \"not\") and hypothetical scenarios (\"if\").\n* **Inclusion of all relevant findings:**  Not omitting key information like \"hurt\" or explicit mentions of cleaning procedures.\n* **Consistent use of \"experienced\":**  Use \"patient\" consistently where applicable.  \n* **Proper qualifier selection:** Carefully differentiate between symptoms, signs, diagnoses. For example, a \"cold\" can be a symptom (patient reported) or a diagnosis (clinician determined).  \"Ear discharge\" can be a sign or a symptom.\n* **Contextual awareness for SNOMED CT coding:** Choosing the most appropriate code based on the context, such as differentiating between different types of ear discharge or infection based on the description.\n\nI am prepared to apply these lessons to the next clinical letter.\n"

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nHistory:\nThe patient is a 53-year-old male who was seen for evaluation at the request of Dr. X regarding recurrent jaw pain. This patient has been having what he described as numbness and tingling along the jaw, teeth, and tongue. This numbness has been present for approximately two months. It seems to be there \"all the time.\" He was seen by his dentist and after dental evaluation was noted to be \"okay.\" He had been diagnosed with a throat infection about a week ago and is finishing a course of Avelox at this time. He has been taking cough drops and trying to increase his fluids. He has recently stopped tobacco. He has been chewing tobacco for about 30 years. Again, there is concern regarding the numbness he has been having. He has had a loss of sensation of taste as well. Numbness seems to be limited just to the left lateral tongue and the jaw region and extends from the angle of the jaw to the lip. He does report he has had about a 20-pound of weight gain over the winter, but notes he has had this in the past just simply from decreased activity. He has had no trauma to the face. He does note a history of headaches. These are occasional and he gets these within the neck area when they do flare up. The headaches are noted to be less than one or two times per month. The patient does note he has a history of anxiety disorder as well. He has tried to eliminate his amount of tobacco and he is actually taking Nicorette gum at this time. He denies any fever or chills. He is not having any dental pain with biting down. He has had no jaw popping and no trismus noted. The patient is concerned regarding this numbness and presents today for further workup, evaluation, and treatment.\n\nReview Of Systems:\nOther than those listed above were otherwise negative.\n\nPast Surgical History:\nPertinent for hernia repair.\n\nFamily History:\nPertinent for hypertension.\n\nCurrent Medications:\nTylenol. He is on Nicorette gum.\n\nAllergies:\nHe is allergic to codeine, unknown reaction.\n\nSocial History:\nThe patient is single, self-employed carpenter. He chews tobacco or having chewing tobacco for 30 years, about half a can per day, but notes he has been recently off, and he does note occasional moderate alcohol use.\n\nPhysical Examination:\nVITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse 64 and regular, temperature 98.3, and weight is 191 pounds.   GENERAL: The patient is an alert, cooperative, obese, 53-year-old male with a normal-sounding voice and good memory.   HEAD & FACE: Inspected with no scars, lesions or masses noted. Sinuses palpated and are normal. Salivary glands also palpated and are normal with no masses noted. The patient also has full facial function.   CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart regular rate and rhythm without murmur.   RESPIRATORY: Lungs auscultated and noted to be clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezing or rubs and normal respiratory effort.   EYES: Extraocular muscles were tested and within normal limits.   EARS: Both ears, external ears are normal. The ear canals are clean and dry. The drums are intact and mobile. He does have moderate tympanosclerosis noted, no erythema. Weber exam is midline. Hearing is grossly intact and normal.   NASAL: Reveals a deviated nasal septum to the left, moderate, clear drainage, and no erythema.   ORAL: Oral cavity is normal with good moisture. Lips, teeth and gums are normal. Evaluation of the oropharynx reveals normal mucosa, normal palates, and posterior oropharynx. Examination of the larynx with a mirror reveals normal epiglottis, false and true vocal cords with good mobility of the cords. The nasopharynx was briefly examined by mirror with normal appearing mucosa, posterior choanae and eustachian tubes.   NECK: The neck was examined with normal appearance. Trachea in the midline. The thyroid was normal, nontender, with no palpable masses or adenopathy noted.   NEUROLOGIC: He does have slightly decreased sensation to the left jaw. He is able to feel pressure on touch. This extends also on to the left lateral tongue and the left intrabuccal mucosa.   DERMATOLOGIC: Evaluation reveals no masses or lesions. Skin turgor is normal.\n\nProcedure:\nA fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy was also performed. See separate operative report in chart. This does reveal a moderately deviated nasal septum to the left, large inferior turbinates, no mass or neoplasm noted.\n\nImpression:\n1. Persistent paresthesia of the left manual teeth and tongue, consider possible neoplasm within the mandible.   2. History of tobacco use.   3. Hypogeusia with loss of taste.   4. Headaches.   5. Xerostomia.\n\nRecommendations:\nI have ordered a CT of the head. This includes sinuses and mandible. This is primarily to evaluate and make sure there is not a neoplasm as the source of this numbness that he has had. On the mucosal surface, I do not see any evidence of malignancy and no visible or palpable masses were noted. I did recommend he increase his fluid intake. He is to remain off the tobacco. I have scheduled a recheck with me in the next two to three weeks to make further recommendations at that time.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
