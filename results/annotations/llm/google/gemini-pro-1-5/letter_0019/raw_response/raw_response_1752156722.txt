Yes, I am ready for the next letter.  I have reviewed the gold-standard annotation and will incorporate the following improvements in my future analyses:

* **Consistent use of lowercase for qualifiers:**  I will use "symptoms", "signs", "diagnoses", "treatment", etc.
* **More precise SNOMED CT codes where possible:** I will strive to use the most specific codes available.
* **Careful consideration of presence:** Paying close attention to negated findings ("no", "not") and hypothetical scenarios ("if").
* **Inclusion of all relevant findings:**  Not omitting key information like "hurt" or explicit mentions of cleaning procedures.
* **Consistent use of "experienced":**  Use "patient" consistently where applicable.  
* **Proper qualifier selection:** Carefully differentiate between symptoms, signs, diagnoses. For example, a "cold" can be a symptom (patient reported) or a diagnosis (clinician determined).  "Ear discharge" can be a sign or a symptom.
* **Contextual awareness for SNOMED CT coding:** Choosing the most appropriate code based on the context, such as differentiating between different types of ear discharge or infection based on the description.

I am prepared to apply these lessons to the next clinical letter.
