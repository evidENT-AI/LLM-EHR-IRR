(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "Yes, I am ready for the next letter.  I have reviewed the gold-standard annotation and taken note of the following differences and areas for improvement in my own approach:\n\n* **Qualifier Accuracy:** I misclassified some labels, such as \"cold\" and \"ear discharge,\" as Diagnoses/Signs when they should have been Symptoms. I will focus on more accurately distinguishing between these categories.\n* **SNOMED CT Codes:** My SNOMED CT codes were sometimes inaccurate or missing. I will prioritize finding the correct codes or using \"NA\" only when absolutely necessary.\n* **Presence Accuracy:**  Paying closer attention to negation is crucial. For example, \"hurt\" was negated, and I missed that.  Similarly, \"throat looks clear\" implies the *absence* of inflammation, so presence should be \"Negated.\"  I'll refine my analysis to capture these nuances.\n* **\"experiencer\" field:** I used \"Patient\", \"Family\" or \"NA\", whereas the gold standard used \"patient.\" I will standardize to lowercase \"patient\" going forward.\n* **Contextual Completeness:** I sometimes provided incomplete contexts.  The gold standard often provides slightly more surrounding text for clarity, which I will emulate.\n* **Label Granularity:**  I missed some labels entirely, like \"hurt,\" \"cleaned,\" \"Q-tip,\" and \"peroxide.\" I need to be more thorough in identifying all relevant entities within the text. I also included \"six weeks ago\" which the gold standard did not. I will focus on clinical findings only.\n\n\nI will apply these learnings to the next clinical letter.\n"

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis:\nObstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy with chronic recurrent pharyngitis.\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nObstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy with chronic recurrent pharyngitis.\n\nSurgical Procedure Performed:\nTonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral endotracheal technique.\n\nSurgical Findings:\nA 4+/4+ cryptic and hypertrophic tonsils with 2+/3+ hypertrophic adenoid pads.\n\nIndications:\nWe were requested to evaluate the patient for complaints of enlarged tonsils, which cause difficulty swallowing, recurrent pharyngitis, and sleep-induced respiratory disturbance. She was evaluated and scheduled for an elective procedure.\n\nDescription Of Surgery:\nThe patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthetic was administered. Once appropriate anesthetic findings were achieved, the patient was intubated and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for a tonsillectomy. He was placed in semi-Rose ___ position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx. Under an operating headlight, the oropharynx was clearly visualized. The right tonsil was grasped with the fossa triangularis and using electrocautery enucleation technique, was removed from its fossa. This followed placing the patient in a suspension position using a McIvor-type mouth gag and a red rubber Robinson catheter via the right naris. Once the right tonsil was removed, the left tonsil was removed in a similar manner, once again using a needle point Bovie dissection at 20 watts. With the tonsils removed, it was possible to visualize the adenoid pads. The oropharynx was irrigated and the adenoid pad evaluated with an indirect mirror technique. The adenoid pad was greater than 2+/4 and hypertrophic. It was removed with successive passes of electrocautery suction. The tonsillar fossa was then once again hemostased with suction cautery, injected with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution and then closed with 2-0 Monocryl on an SH needle. The redundant soft tissue of the uvula was removed posteriorly and cauterized with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period. The patient's oropharynx and nasopharynx were irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline contained with small amount of iodine, and she was recovered from her general endotracheal anesthetic. She was extubated and left the operating room in good condition to the postoperative recovery room area.     Estimated blood loss was minimal. There were no complications. Specimens produced were right and left tonsils. The adenoid pad was ablated with electrocautery.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
