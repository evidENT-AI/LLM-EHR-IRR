good mobility of both it and incus,"palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified.",signs,right,confirmed,,patient,,
no movement of the stapes,"palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified.",signs,right,negated,,patient,,
no movement,palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement.,signs,right,negated,,patient,,
trauma to the chorda tympani,a house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani.,risk factors,right,negated,,patient,,
desiccation,the nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well.,risk factors,right,negated,,patient,,44137002
fenestration,the fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation.,signs,right,confirmed,,patient,,
postoperative drainage of perilymph,small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph.,risk factors,right,negated,,patient,post-treatment,
