Manifests in mid-adulthood with the development of telangiectasia mostly on the face, trunk and arms, as well as with erythrocytosis that may cause a red facies and occasionally, headaches. The increased serum erythropoietin levels precede the intrapulmonary shunting. The intrapulmonary shunts cause hypoxia which slowly progresses until the person needs continuous supplemental oxygen. Blood clots, probably due to erythrocytosis, and bleeding in the brain have also been reported in some affected individuals. Monoclonal gammopathy and perinephric fluid collections are usually found incidentally and do not seem to cause any complications. The syndrome has a slow and regular progression. The cause of TEMPI syndrome is currently unknown. The abnormal plasma-cell clone and/or the monoclonal gammopathy are suggested to be triggers of the disease.",
