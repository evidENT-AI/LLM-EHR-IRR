(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "Yes, I am ready for the next letter.  I've reviewed the gold-standard annotation and noted the following areas for improvement in my own annotations:\n\n* **Qualifier Consistency:** I will pay closer attention to differentiating between signs, symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and procedures.  The gold standard uses \"symptoms\" for patient-reported issues like \"cold\" and \"ear discharge,\" while I sometimes used \"diagnoses\" or \"signs.\" I will prioritize using \"symptoms\" for patient-reported experiences.  Similarly, some actions I classified as \"treatments\" were better suited as \"procedures\" in the gold standard.\n* **Presence Accuracy:**  For conditional statements (e.g., \"If there is any ear drainage\"), the gold standard correctly uses \"NA\" for presence, which I sometimes marked as \"Suspected.\" I will use \"NA\" for presence when the existence of a condition is hypothetical.\n* **Context Completeness:** I will ensure the context includes the full relevant phrase, as the gold standard sometimes includes more complete phrases than I did.\n* **SNOMED CT Codes:** I will strive for greater accuracy and completeness in providing SNOMED CT codes.\n* **Experiencer Field:** I used the field \"experiencer\" instead of \"experienced\". I will correct this in future annotations.\n\nI will apply these lessons to the next clinical letter.\n"

Risks and benefits of surgery including risk of bleeding, general anesthesia, tympanic membrane perforation as well as persistent recurrent otitis media were discussed with the patient and parents and informed consent was signed by the parents.\n\nFindings:\nThe patient was brought to the operating room, placed in supine position, given general endotracheal anesthesia. The left ear was then draped in a clean fashion. Under microscopic visualization, the ear canal was cleaned of the wax. Myringotomy incision was made in the anterior inferior quadrant. There was no fluid in the middle ear space. A Micron Bobbin tube was easily placed. Floxin drops were placed in the ear. The same was performed on the right side with similar findings. The patient was then turned to be placed in Rose position. The patient draped in clean fashion. A small McIvor mouth gag was used to hold open the oral cavity. The soft palate was palpated. There was no submucous cleft felt. Using a 1:1 mixture of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine and 0.25% Marcaine, both tonsillar pillars and the fossae injected with approximately 7 mL total. Using a curved Allis the right tonsil was grasped and pulled medially. Tonsil was dissected off the tonsillar fossa using a Coblator. The left tonsil was removed in the similar fashion. Hemostasis then achieved in tonsillar fossa using the Coblator on coagulation setting. The soft palate was then retracted using red rubber catheter. Under mirror visualization, the patient was found to have enlarged adenoids. The adenoids were removed using the Coblator. Hemostasis was also achieved using the Coblator on coagulation setting. The rubber catheter was then removed. Reexamining the oropharynx, small bleeding points were cauterized with the Coblator. Stomach contents were then aspirated with saline sump. The patient was woken up from anesthesia, extubated and brought to recovery room in stable condition. There were no intraoperative complications. Needle and sponge correct. Estimated blood loss minimal.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
