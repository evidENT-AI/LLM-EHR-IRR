Adrenal failure most often manifests with concurrent mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency (78% of cases). The disease is caused by mutations of the AIRE gene (21q22.3) coding for the AIRE transcription factor, which is involved in immune tolerance mechanisms and contributes to the negative selection of autoreactive T lymphocytes in the thymus, lymph nodes and spleen.
