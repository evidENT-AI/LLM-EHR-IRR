(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "Yes, I am ready for the next letter.  I have reviewed the gold-standard annotation and taken note of the differences, including:\n\n* **Qualifier Discrepancies:**  I noticed some differences in assigning qualifiers (e.g., \"signs\" vs. \"symptoms,\" \"diagnoses\" vs. \"symptoms\").  I will pay closer attention to the precise definitions of these categories in future annotations.\n* **Missing Labels:** I missed some labels entirely (e.g., \"hurt,\" \"cleaned,\" \"Q-tip,\" \"peroxide\"). I will strive to be more thorough in identifying all relevant information.\n* **Context Selection:** Some of my contexts were too broad.  The gold standard uses more focused contexts, often just the relevant phrase. I will aim for greater precision in selecting context.\n* **SNOMED CT Codes:** My SNOMED CT codes were sometimes inaccurate or missing. I will prioritize finding the correct codes or using \"NA\" when appropriate.\n* **Presence Field:**  I sometimes misclassified the \"presence\" field, especially for negated findings. I will focus on accurately reflecting whether a condition is present, absent, or uncertain.\n* **Experiencer Field:** The gold standard uses \"experienced\" rather than \"experiencer\". I will correct this in future outputs.\n* **Label Text:** I sometimes used overly broad phrases for the label text. The gold standard uses more concise and specific terms.  I will aim to extract the most precise label possible.\n\n\nI am prepared to apply these learnings to the next clinical letter.\n"

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis:\nRight tympanic membrane perforation.\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nRight tympanic membrane perforation along with chronic otitis media.\n\nProcedure:\nRight ear examination under anesthesia.\n\nIndications:\nThe patient is a 15-year-old child with history of a right tympanic membrane perforation following tube placement as well as right conductive hearing loss. Exam in the office revealed a posterior superior right marginal tympanic perforation. Risks and benefits of surgery including risk of bleeding, general anesthesia, hearing loss as well as recurrent perforation were discussed with the mother. The mother wished to proceed with surgery.\n\nFindings:\nThe patient was brought to the room, placed in supine position, given general endotracheal anesthesia. The postauricular crease was then injected with 1% Xylocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine along with external meatus. An area of the scalp was shaved above the ear and then also 1% Xylocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine injected, a total of 4 mL local anesthetic was used. The ear was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The microscope was then brought into view and examining the marginal perforation, the patient was noted to have large granuloma under the tympanic membrane at the anterior border of the drum. The granulation tissue was debrided as much as possible. Decision was made to cancel the tympanoplasty after debriding the middle ear space as much as possible. The middle ear space was filled with Floxin drops. The patient woke up anesthesia, extubated, and brought to recovery room in stable condition. There were no intraoperative complications. Needle and sponge was correct. Estimated blood loss minimal.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
