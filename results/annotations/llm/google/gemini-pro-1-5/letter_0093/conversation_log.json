(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

I have reviewed the gold-standard annotation and taken note of the differences, including:\n\n* **Qualifier Consistency:**  Using \"symptoms\" consistently for symptoms (cold, ear discharge) instead of mixing with \"diagnoses\" or \"signs\".\n* **Presence Accuracy:** Correctly identifying negated symptoms like \"hurt\" and \"infected\" as \"Negated\" rather than \"Suspected\" or \"Confirmed\".\n* **SNOMED CT Codes:** Providing more specific and accurate SNOMED CT codes where possible.\n* **Inclusion of Additional Labels:** Including additional relevant labels like \"hurt,\" \"cleaned,\" \"Q-tip,\" and \"peroxide\" which I missed.\n* **Context Specificity:**  Using slightly more concise context phrases while still retaining all relevant information.\n* **\"experiencer\" vs. \"experienced\":** The gold standard uses \"experienced\".

The patient is a 1-year-old male with a history of chronic otitis media with effusion and conductive hearing loss refractory to outpatient medical therapy.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnoses:\n1. Chronic otitis media with effusion.   2. Conductive hearing loss.\n\nPostoperative Diagnoses:\n1. Chronic otitis media with effusion.   2. Conductive hearing loss.\n\nProcedure Performed:\nBilateral tympanostomy with myringotomy tube placement _______ split tube 1.0 mm.\n\nAnesthesia:\nTotal IV general mask airway.\n\nEstimated Blood Loss:\nNone.\n\nComplications:\nNone.\n\nIndications For Procedure:\nThe patient is a 1-year-old male with a history of chronic otitis media with effusion and conductive hearing loss refractory to outpatient medical therapy. After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed with the family, a written consent was obtained for the procedure.\n\nProcedure:\nThe patient was brought to the operative suite by Anesthesia. The patient was placed on the operating table in supine position. After this, the patient was then placed under general mask airway and the patient's head was then turned to the left.     The Zeiss operative microscope and medium-sized ear speculum were placed and the cerumen from the external auditory canals were removed with a cerumen loop to #5 suction. After this, the tympanic membrane is then brought into direct visualization with no signs of any gross retracted pockets or cholesteatoma. A myringotomy incision was then made within the posterior inferior quadrant and the middle ear was then suctioned with a #5 suction demonstrating dry contents. A _____ split tube 1.0 mm was then placed in the myringotomy incision utilizing a alligator forcep. Cortisporin Otic drops were placed followed by cotton balls. Attention was then drawn to the left ear with the head turned to the right and the medium sized ear speculum placed. The external auditory canal was removed off of its cerumen with a #5 suction which led to the direct visualization of the tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane appeared with no signs of retraction pockets, cholesteatoma or air fluid levels. A myringotomy incision was then made within the posterior inferior quadrant with a myringotomy blade after which a _________ split tube 1.0 mm was then placed with an alligator forcep. After this, the patient had Cortisporin Otic drops followed by cotton balls placed. The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia and transferred to recovery room in stable condition and tolerated the procedure very well. The patient will be followed up approximately in one week and was sent home with a prescription for Ciloxan ear drops to be used as directed and with instructions not to get any water in the ears.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
