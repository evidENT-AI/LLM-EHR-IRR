Patients may present at any age with hypocalcemia, tetany, or afebrile convulsions. Hearing loss is usually bilateral and may range from mild to profound impairment. Renal disease manifestations include nephrotic syndrome, cystic kidney, renal dysplasia, hypoplasia or aplasia, pelvicalyceal deformity, vesicoureteral reflux, chronic renal failure, hematuria, proteinuria and renal scarring. The defect in the majority of cases was mapped to chromosome 10p (10pter-p13 region or 10p14-p15.1). Haploinsufficiency (deletions) of zinc-finger transcription factor GATA3, or mutations in the GATA3 gene appear to be the underlying cause of this syndrome.",
