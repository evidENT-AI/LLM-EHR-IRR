(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "I've reviewed the gold-standard annotation and taken note of the differences between it and my previous attempt. I've learned the following key points:\n\n1. **Qualifier variety**: The gold-standard annotation uses a wider range of qualifiers, including \"sign\", \"symptoms\", \"diagnoses\", \"treatment\", and \"treatment_stage\". I'll make sure to use these qualifiers more accurately in the future.\n2. **Laterality and presence**: The gold-standard annotation is more precise in specifying laterality (e.g., \"right\" or \"left\") and presence (e.g., \"Confirmed\" or \"Negated\") for each label.\n3. **Snomed_ct codes**: The gold-standard annotation includes Snomed_ct codes for many labels, which I didn't include in my previous attempt. I'll make sure to include these codes when possible.\n4. **Context and text**: The gold-standard annotation provides more detailed context and text for each label, which helps to clarify the meaning and relevance of the label.\n5. **Treatment_stage**: The gold-standard annotation includes a \"treatment_stage\" field, which I didn't include in my previous attempt. I'll make sure to include this field when relevant.\n6. **Experienced**: The gold-standard annotation uses the \"experienced\" field to specify who experienced the condition or symptom (e.g., \"patient\" or \"family\").\n7. **Primary_secondary**: The gold-standard annotation uses the \"primary_secondary\" field to specify whether the condition or symptom is primary or secondary.\n\nI'm ready to move on to the next letter and apply these lessons to create a high-quality annotation. Please provide the next letter."

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis:\nSubglottic upper tracheal stenosis.\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nSubglottic upper tracheal stenosis.\n\nOperation Preformed:\nDirect laryngoscopy, rigid bronchoscopy and dilation of subglottic upper tracheal stenosis.\n\nIndications For The Surgery:\nThe patient is a 76-year-old white female with a history of subglottic upper tracheal stenosis. She has had undergone multiple previous endoscopic procedures in the past; last procedure was in January 2007. She returns with some increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. Endoscopic reevaluation is offered to her. The patient has been considering laryngotracheal reconstruction; however, due to a recent death in the family, she has postponed this, but she has been having increasing symptoms. An endoscopic treatment was offered to her. Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications involving bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, or swallowing, hoarseness changing permanently, recurrence of stenosis despite a surgical intervention, airway obstruction necessitating a tracheostomy now or in the future, cardiorespiratory, and anesthetic risks were all discussed in length. The patient states she understood and wished to proceed.\n\nDescription Of The Operation:\nThe patient was taken to the operating room, placed on table in supine position. Following adequate general anesthesia, the patient was prepared for endoscopy. The top sliding laryngoscope was then inserted in the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx examined. In the oral cavity, she had good dentition. Tongue and buccal cavity mucosa were without ulcers, masses, or lesions. The oropharynx was clear. The larynx was then manually suspended. Epiglottis area, epiglottic folds, false cords, true vocal folds with some mild edema, but otherwise, without ulcers, masses, or lesions, and the supraglottic and glottic airway were widely patent. The larynx was manually suspended and a 5 x 30 pediatric rigid bronchoscope was passed through the vocal folds. At the base of the subglottis, there was a narrowing and in the upper trachea, restenosis had occurred. Moderate amount of mucoid secretions, these were suctioned, following which the area of stenosis was dilated. Remainder of the bronchi was then examined. The mid and distal trachea were widely patent. Pale pink mucosa takeoff from mainstem bronchi were widely patent without ulcers, lesions, or evidence of scarring. The scope was pulled back and removed and following this, a 6 x 30 pediatric rigid bronchoscope was passed through the larynx and further dilatation carried out. Once this had been completed, dramatic improvement in the subglottic upper tracheal airway accomplished. Instrumentation was removed and a #6 endotracheal tube, uncuffed, was placed to allow smooth emerge from anesthesia. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
