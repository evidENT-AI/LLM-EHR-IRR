(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "I've reviewed the gold-standard annotation and taken note of the differences between it and my previous attempt. I've learned the following key points:\n\n1. **Qualifier variety**: The gold-standard annotation uses a wider range of qualifiers, including \"sign\", \"symptoms\", \"diagnoses\", \"treatment\", and \"treatment_stage\". I'll make sure to use these qualifiers more accurately in the future.\n2. **Laterality and presence**: The gold-standard annotation is more precise in specifying laterality (e.g., \"right\" or \"left\") and presence (e.g., \"Confirmed\" or \"Negated\") for each label.\n3. **Snomed_ct codes**: The gold-standard annotation includes Snomed_ct codes for many labels, which I didn't include in my previous attempt. I'll make sure to include these codes when possible.\n4. **Context and text**: The gold-standard annotation provides more detailed context and text for each label, which helps to clarify the meaning and relevance of the label.\n5. **Treatment_stage**: The gold-standard annotation includes a \"treatment_stage\" field, which I didn't include in my previous attempt. I'll make sure to include this field when relevant.\n6. **Experienced**: The gold-standard annotation uses the \"experienced\" field to specify who experienced the condition or symptom (e.g., \"patient\" or \"family\"). I'll make sure to include this field when relevant.\n7. **Primary_secondary**: The gold-standard annotation uses the \"primary_secondary\" field to specify whether the condition or symptom is primary or secondary. I'll make sure to include this field when relevant.\n\nI'm ready to move on to the next letter and apply these lessons to create a high-quality annotation. Please provide the next letter."

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nChief Complaint:\nRecurrent nasal obstruction.\n\nHistory Of Present Illness:\nThe patient is a 5-year-old male, who was last evaluated by Dr. F approximately one year ago for suspected nasal obstruction, possible sleep apnea. Dr. F's assessment at that time was the patient not had sleep apnea and did not truly even seem to have allergic rhinitis. All of his symptoms had resolved when he had seen Dr. F, so no surgical plan was made and no further followup was needed. However, the patient reports again today with his mother that they are now having continued symptoms of nasal obstruction and questionable sleep changes. Again, the mother gives a very confusing sleep history but it does not truly sound like the child is having apneic events that are obstructive in nature. It sounds like he is snoring loudly and does have some nasal obstruction at nighttime. He also is sniffing a lot through his nose. He has been tried on some nasal steroids but they only use this on a p.r.n. basis about one or two days every month and we are unsure if that has even helped at all, probably not. The child is not having any problems with his ears including ear infections or hearing. He is also not having any problems with strep throat.\n\nPast Medical History:\nEczema.\n\nPast Surgical History:\nNone.\n\nMedications:\nNone.\n\nAllergies:\nNo known drug allergies.\n\nFamily History:\nNo family history of bleeding diathesis or anesthesia difficulties.\n\nPhysical Examination:\nVITAL SIGNS: Weight 43 pounds, height 37 inches, temperature 97.4, pulse 65, and blood pressure 104/48.   GENERAL: The patient is a well-nourished male in no acute distress. Listening to his voice today in the clinic, he does not sound to have a hyponasal voice and has a wide range of consonant pronunciation.   NOSE: Anterior rhinoscopy does demonstrate boggy turbinates bilaterally with minimal amount of watery rhinorrhea.   EARS: The patient tympanic membranes are clear and intact bilaterally. There is no middle ear effusion.   ORAL CAVITY: The patient has 2+ tonsils bilaterally. There are clearly nonobstructive. His uvula is midline.   NECK: No lymphadenopathy appreciated.\n\nAssessment And Plan:\nThis is a 5-year-old male, who presents for repeat evaluation of a possible nasal obstruction, questionable sleep apnea. Again, the mother gives a confusing sleep history but it does not really sound like he is having apneic events. They deny any actual gasping events. It sounds like true obstructive events. He clearly has some symptoms at this point that would suggest possible allergic rhinitis or chronic rhinitis. I think the most appropriate way to proceed would be to first try this child on a nasal corticosteroid and use it appropriately. I have given them prescription for Nasacort Aqua one spray to each nostril twice a day. I instructed them on correct way to use this and the importance to use it on a daily basis. They may not see any benefit for several weeks. I would like to evaluate him in six weeks to see how we are progressing. If he continues to have problems, I think at that point we may consider performing a transnasal exam in the office to examine his adenoid bed and that would really be the only surgical option for this child. He may also need an allergy evaluation at that point if he continues to have problems. However, I would like to be fairly conservative in this child. Should the mother still have concerns regarding his sleeping at our next visit or should his symptoms worsen (I did instruct her call us if it worsens), we may even need to pursue a sleep study just to settle that issue once and for all. We will see him back in six weeks.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
