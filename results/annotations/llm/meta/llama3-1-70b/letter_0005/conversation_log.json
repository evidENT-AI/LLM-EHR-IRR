(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

I've learned the following key points:\n\n1. **Qualifier variety**: The gold-standard annotation uses a wider range of qualifiers, including \"sign\", \"symptoms\", \"diagnoses\", \"treatment\", and \"treatment_stage\". I'll make sure to use these qualifiers more accurately in the future.\n2. **Laterality and presence**: I'll pay closer attention to laterality (left, right, bilateral, or NA) and presence (confirmed, suspected, resolved, negated, or NA) for each label.\n3. **Snomed_ct codes**: I'll make sure to include Snomed_ct codes where available, and use \"NA\" when they are not applicable.\n4. **Context and text**: I'll ensure that the context and text fields accurately reflect the information in the letter, and that the text field is an exact quote from the letter.\n5. **Experienced and experiencer**: I'll use the correct terminology for \"experienced\" and \"experiencer\", which refers to the person experiencing the condition or treatment (e.g., patient, family member).\n6. **Treatment stage**: I'll pay attention to the treatment stage (pre-treatment, post-treatment, or NA) for each label.\n7. **Negated conditions**: I'll make sure to annotate negated conditions (e.g., \"no ear discharge\", \"throat looks clear\") accurately.\n\nI'm ready to move on to the next letter and apply these learnings to create high-quality annotations.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis:\nChronic hypertrophic adenotonsillitis.\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nChronic hypertrophic adenotonsillitis.\n\nOperative Procedure:\nAdenotonsillectomy, primary, patient under age 12.\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral endotracheal anesthesia.\n\nProcedure In Detail:\nThis patient was brought from the holding area and did receive preoperative antibiotics of Cleocin as well as IV Decadron. She was placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without difficulty. In the holding area, her allergies were reviewed. It is unclear whether she is actually allergic to penicillin. Codeine caused her to be excitable, but she did not actually have an allergic reaction to codeine. She might be allergic to BACTRIM and SULFA. After positioning a small shoulder roll and draping sterilely, McIvor mouthgag, #3 blade was inserted and suspended from the Mayo stand. There was no bifid uvula or submucous cleft. She had 3+ cryptic tonsils with significant debris in the tonsillar crypts. Injection at each peritonsillar area with 0.25% with Marcaine with 1:200,000 Epinephrine, approximately 1.5 mL total volume. The left superior tonsillar pole was then grasped with curved Allis forceps. _______ incision and dissection in the tonsillar capsule and hemostasis and removal of the tonsil was obtained with Coblation Evac Xtra Wand on 7/3. Mouthgag was released, reopened, no bleeding was seen. The right tonsil was then removed in the same fashion. The mouthgag released, reopened, and no bleeding was seen. Small red rubber catheter in the nasal passage was used to retract the soft palate. She had mild-to-moderate adenoidal tissue residual. It was removed with Coblation Evac Xtra gently curved Wand on 9/5. Red rubber catheter was then removed. Mouthgag was again released, reopened, no bleeding was seen. Orogastric suction carried out with only scant clear stomach contents. Mouthgag was then removed. Teeth and lips were inspected and were in their preoperative condition. The patient then awakened, extubated, and taken to recovery room in good condition.\n\nTotal Blood Loss From Tonsillectomy:\nLess than 2 mL.\n\nTotal Blood Loss From Adenoidectomy:\nLess than 2 mL.\n\nComplications:\nNo intraoperative events or complications occurred.\n\nPlan:\nFamily will be counseled postoperatively. Postoperatively, the patient will be on Zithromax oral suspension 500 mg daily for 5 to 7 days, Lortab Elixir for pain. _______ and promethazine if needed for nausea and vomiting.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
