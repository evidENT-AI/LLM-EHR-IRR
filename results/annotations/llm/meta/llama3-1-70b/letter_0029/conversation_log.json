(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

I've learned the following key points:\n\n1. **Qualifier variety**: The gold-standard annotation uses a wider range of qualifiers, including \"sign\", \"symptoms\", \"diagnoses\", \"treatment\", and \"treatment_stage\". I'll make sure to use these qualifiers more accurately in the future.\n2. **Laterality and presence**: I'll pay closer attention to laterality (left, right, bilateral, or NA) and presence (confirmed, suspected, resolved, negated, or NA) for each label.\n3. **Snomed_ct codes**: I'll make sure to include Snomed_ct codes where available, and use \"NA\" when not applicable.\n4. **Context and text**: I'll ensure that the context and text fields accurately reflect the information in the letter.\n5. **Experienced and experiencer**: I'll use \"experienced\" and \"experiencer\" correctly, with \"experienced\" referring to the person experiencing the condition or treatment, and \"experiencer\" referring to the person performing the action (e.g., the doctor).\n6. **Treatment_stage**: I'll use \"treatment_stage\" to indicate whether the treatment is pre-treatment, post-treatment, or NA.\n7. **Negated conditions**: I'll make sure to annotate negated conditions (e.g., \"no ear discharge\") correctly, using the \"Negated\" presence value.\n\nI'm ready to move on to the next letter and apply these lessons to create accurate annotations."
