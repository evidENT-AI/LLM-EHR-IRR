(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

I've learned the following key points:\n\n1. **Qualifier variety**: The gold-standard annotation uses a wider range of qualifiers, including \"sign\", \"symptoms\", \"diagnoses\", \"treatment\", and \"treatment_stage\". I'll make sure to use these qualifiers more accurately in the future.\n2. **Laterality and presence**: I'll pay closer attention to laterality (left, right, bilateral, or NA) and presence (confirmed, suspected, resolved, negated, or NA) for each label.\n3. **Snomed_ct codes**: I'll try to include Snomed_ct codes where possible, even if they're not always available.\n4. **Context and text**: I'll ensure that the context and text fields accurately reflect the information in the letter.\n5. **Experienced and experiencer**: I'll use the correct terminology for \"experienced\" and \"experiencer\" fields.\n6. **Treatment_stage**: I'll include the treatment stage (pre-treatment, post-treatment, or NA) for each label where applicable.\n7. **Negated findings**: I'll make sure to include negated findings, such as \"no ear discharge\" or \"throat looks clear\", as separate labels.\n8. **Multiple labels per sentence**: I'll be aware that a single sentence can contain multiple labels, each with its own qualifier, laterality, presence, and other metadata.\n\nI'm ready to move on to the next letter and apply these lessons to create accurate and comprehensive annotations."

Cosmetic rhinoplasty.   4. Left inferior turbinectomy.\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral via endotracheal tube.\n\nIndications For Operation:\nThe patient is with symptomatic nasal obstruction and fixed nasal valve collapse following a previous nasal fracture and attempted repair. We discussed with the patient the indications, risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the proposed surgical procedure, she had her questions asked and answered. Preoperative imaging was performed in consultation with regard to aesthetic results and communicated via the computerized imager. The patient had questions asked and answered. Informed consent was obtained.\n\nProcedure In Detail:\nThe patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position. The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. The patient was converted to the lounge chair position, and the nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion. Procedure began with an inverted going incision and elevation of the skin of the nose in the submucoperichondrial plane over the medial crural footplates and lower lateral cartilages and up over the dorsum. The septal angle was approached and submucoperichondrial flaps were elevated. Severe nasal septal deviation to the right hand side and evidence of an old fracture with a separate alignment of the cartilaginous nose from the bony nose was encountered. The upper laterals were divided and medial and lateral osteotomies were carried out. Inadequate septal cartilage was noted to be present for use as spreader graft; therefore, left postauricular incision was made, and the conchal bowl cartilage graft was harvested, and it was closed with 3-0 running locking chromic with a sterile cotton ball pressure dressing applied. Ear cartilage graft was then placed to put two spreader grafts on the left and one the right. The two on the left extended all the way up to the caudal tip, the one on the right just primarily the medial wall. It was placed in such a way to correct a caudal dorsal deviation of the nasal tip septum. The upper lateral cartilage was noted to be of the same width and length in size. Yet, the left lower cartilage was scarred and adherent to the upper lateral cartilage. The upper lateral cartilages were noted to be excessive of uneven length with the right being much taller than the left and that was shortened to the same length. The scar bands were released in the lower lateral cartilages to the upper lateral cartilages to allow free mobilization of the lower lateral cartilages. A middle crus stitch was used to unite the domes, and then the nose was projected by suturing the medial crural footplates of the caudal septum in deep projected fashion. Crushed ear cartilage was then placed in the pockets above the spreader grafts in the area of the deficient dorsal nasal height and the lateral nasal sidewall height. The spreader brought an excellent aesthetic appearance to the nose. We left more than 1 cm of dorsal and caudal support for the nasal tip and dorsum height. Mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture. The skin was closed with 5-0 chromic and 6-0 fast absorbing gut. Doyle splints were placed on each side of nasal septum and secured with 3-0 nylon and a Denver splint was applied. The patient was awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
