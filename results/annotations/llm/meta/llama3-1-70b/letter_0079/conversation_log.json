(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "I've reviewed the gold-standard annotation and taken note of the differences between it and my previous attempt. I've learned the following key points:\n\n1. **Qualifier variety**: The gold-standard annotation uses a wider range of qualifiers, including \"sign\", \"symptoms\", \"diagnoses\", \"treatment\", and \"treatment_stage\". I'll make sure to use these qualifiers more accurately in the future.\n2. **Laterality and presence**: The gold-standard annotation is more precise in specifying laterality (e.g., \"right\", \"left\", or \"NA\") and presence (e.g., \"Confirmed\", \"Negated\", or \"NA\").\n3. **Snomed_ct codes**: The gold-standard annotation includes Snomed_ct codes for many of the labels, which I didn't include in my previous attempt. I'll make sure to include these codes when possible.\n4. **Context and text**: The gold-standard annotation provides more detailed context and text for each label, which helps to clarify the meaning and relevance of the label.\n5. **Treatment_stage**: The gold-standard annotation includes a \"treatment_stage\" field, which I didn't include in my previous attempt. I'll make sure to include this field when relevant.\n6. **Experienced**: The gold-standard annotation uses the \"experienced\" field to specify who experienced the condition or treatment (e.g., \"patient\" or \"NA\").\n7. **Primary_secondary**: The gold-standard annotation uses the \"primary_secondary\" field to specify whether the condition or treatment is primary or secondary (e.g., \"Primary\" or \"NA\").\n\nI'm ready to move on to the next letter and apply these lessons to create a high-quality annotation. Please provide the next letter."

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nSubjective:\nA 6-year-old boy who underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy two weeks ago. Also, I cleaned out his maxillary sinuses. Symptoms included loud snoring at night, sinus infections, throat infections, not sleeping well, and fatigue. The surgery went well, and I had planned for him to stay overnight, but Mom reminds me that by about 8 p.m. the night nurse gotten him to take fluids well and we let him go home then that evening. He finished up his Augmentin, by a day or two later he was off the Lortab. Mom has not noticed any unusual voice change. No swallowing difficulty except he does not like the taste of acidic foods such as tomato sauce. He has not had any nasal discharge or ever had any bleeding. He seems to be breathing better.\n\nObjective:\nExam looks good. The pharynx is well healed. Tongue mobility is normal. Voice sounds clear. Nasal passages reveal no discharge or crusting.\n\nRecommendation:\nI told Mom it is okay to use some ibuprofen in case his mouth or jaws are still sensitive. He says it seems to hurt if he opens his mouth real wide such as when he brushes his teeth. It is okay to chew gum and it is okay to eat crunchy foods such as potato chips. The pathologist described the expected changes of chronic sinusitis and chronic hypertrophic tonsillitis and adenoiditis, and there were no atypical findings on the laboratories.     I am glad he has healed up well. There are no other restrictions or limitations. I told Mom, I had written to Dr. XYZ to let her know of the findings. The child will continue his regular followup visits with his family doctor, and I told Mom I would be happy to see him anytime if needed. He did very well after surgery and he seems to feel better and breathe a lot better after his throat and sinus procedure.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
