argon laser application,the self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse.,treatments,right,confirmed,primary,,pre-treatment,
stapes superstructure mobilization,the stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured.,procedures,right,confirmed,primary,,pre-treatment,
fenestration creation,the fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation.,procedures,right,confirmed,primary,,pre-treatment,
