(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n\nRemember, you must follow these rules when generating JSON:\n1.

She currently is trach dependent for her airway because of glottic and subglottic stenosis, but she is having no significant problems breathing and talking around her trach tube and came for further evaluation.

Risk and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of with speech or swallowing, failure to improve her airway, and loss of voice. Cardiorespiratory anesthetic results were discussed in length. The patient states she understood and wished to proceed.\n\nDescription Of Operation:\nThe patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position. Under adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient's #5 metal tracheostomy tube was removed and a #5 laser-safe endotracheal tube was inserted. The patient was then prepared for endoscopy. The Kantor laryngoscope was then inserted. Oral cavity, hypopharynx, larynx, and nasal cavity showed good dentition with good tongue, buccal cavity, and mucosa without lesions. Larynx was then ***** short epiglottis. Larynx was suspended with significant scarring beginning in the supraglottic area with loss of laryngeal contour beginning in the supraglottis with extensive scar tissue at the level of the false cord obliteration of ventricles and true cords. This appeared to be stable, and airway was patent at the supraglottic and glottic level with some narrowing at the subglottic level with mild-to-moderate subglottic stenosis, otherwise this appeared to be stable. However, distally, the level of the trach site examined with the microscope and 0 and 30-degree telescopes. The patient noted to have marked narrowing with dense scarring posterolaterally on the left securing good visualization of the trach tube. The laryngoscope was removed, and a 5 x 30 pediatric rigid bronchoscope was then passed. The LP contact tip laser was utilized to vaporize the scar tissue and release the scar banding following which the scope was passed and further dilation carried out. Mid and distal trachea were widely patent. Trachea and mainstem bronchi were patent without obvious disease. The patient did not appear to have any relapsing polychondritis with progressive scar tissue at the level of the trach site and the posterior trachea wall was significant. This was further dilated and following which was removed and a new #5 metal tracheostomy tube inserted. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications and was taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
