lidocaine,"now attention was directed to the posterior pillars. a hemostat was used to clamp the posterior pillar, which was then taken down with metzenbaum scissors. the posterior pillar was then approximated to the anterior pillar with the use of #3-0 pds suture so as to create a box shaped soft palate. now, the uvula was reflected onto the soft palate and #12 blade scalpel was used to incise the mucosa of the soft palate extending down onto the uvula. the mucosa was dissected off with the use of potts scissors. now the uvula was reflected onto the soft palate and sutured down in place with use of #3-0 pds suture approximated with deep muscle layers. now the mucosa of the soft palate and the uvula were approximated with interrupted #3-0 pds sutures. finally, #4-0 vicryl sutures were placed intermittently between the pds to further secure the uvula, which had been reflected onto the soft palate. a final #3-0 pds suture was used to further approximate the anterior and posterior tonsil pillars. final inspection did not reveal any further bleeding. the mouth was then irrigated with saline and suctioned. at this point, the procedure was complete. he was awakened and taken to recovery room in stable condition. he will be admitted as an observation patient to the telemetry floor for routine postoperative management. of note, iv decadron was administered during the procedure.",treatments,,confirmed,primary,,post-treatment,
