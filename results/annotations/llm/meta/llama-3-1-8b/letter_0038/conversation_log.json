(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n\nRemember, you must follow these rules when generating JSON:\n1.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnoses:\n1. Dysphagia.   2. Right parapharyngeal hemorrhagic lesion.\n\nPostoperative Diagnoses:\n1. Dysphagia with no signs of piriform sinus pooling or aspiration.   2. No parapharyngeal hemorrhagic lesion noted.   3. Right parapharyngeal lesion, likely thyroid cartilage, nonhemorrhagic.\n\nProcedure Performed:\nFiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy.\n\nAnesthesia:\nNone.\n\nComplications:\nNone.\n\nIndications For Procedure:\nThe patient is a 93-year-old Caucasian male who was admitted to ABCD General Hospital on 08/07/2003 secondary to ischemic ulcer on the right foot. ENT was asked to see the patient regarding postop dysphagia with findings at that time of the consultation on 08/17/03 with a fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy, a right parapharyngeal hemorrhagic lesion possibly secondary to LMA intubation. The patient subsequently resolved with his dysphagia and workup of Speech was obtained, which showed no aspiration, no pooling, minimal premature spillage with solids, but good protection of the airway. This is a reevaluation of the right parapharyngeal hemorrhagic lesion that was noted prior.\n\nProcedure Details:\nThe patient was brought in the semi-Fowler's position, a fiberoptic nasal laryngoscope was then passed into the patient's right nasal passage, all the way to the nasopharynx. The scope was then flexed caudally and advanced slowly through the nasopharynx into the oropharynx, and down to the hypopharynx. The patient's oro and nasopharynx all appeared normal with no signs of any gross lesions, edema, or ecchymosis.     Within the hypopharynx although there was an area of fullness and on the right side around the level of the thyroid cartilage cornu that seemed to be prominent and within the lumen of the hypopharynx. There were no signs of any obstruction. The epiglottis, piriform sinuses, vallecula, and base of tongue all appeared normal with no signs of any gross lesions. The patient with excellent phonation with good glottic closure upon phonation and no signs of any aspiration or pooling of secretions. The scope was then pulled out and the patient tolerated the procedure well. At this time, we will follow up as an outpatient and possibly there is a need for a microscopic suspension direct laryngoscopy for evaluation of this right parapharyngeal lesion.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
