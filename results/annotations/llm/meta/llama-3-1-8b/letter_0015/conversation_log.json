(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n\nRemember, you must follow these rules when generating JSON:\n1.

Repair of cleft soft palate and excise accessory ear tag, right ear.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis:\nCleft soft palate.\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nCleft soft palate.\n\nProcedures:\n1. Repair of cleft soft palate, CPT 42200.   2. Excise accessory ear tag, right ear.\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral.\n\nDescription Of Procedure:\nThe patient was placed supine on the operating room table. After anesthesia was administered, time out was taken to ensure correct patient, procedure, and site. The face was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The right ear tag was examined first. This was a small piece of skin and cartilaginous material protruding just from the tragus. The lesion was excised and injected with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and then excised using an elliptical-style incision. Dissection was carried down the subcutaneous tissue to remove any cartilaginous attachment to the tragus. After this was done, the wound was cauterized and then closed using interrupted 5-0 Monocryl. Attention was then turned towards the palate. The Dingman mouthgag was inserted and the palate was injected with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine. After giving this 5 minutes to take effect, the palate was incised along its margins. The anterior oral mucosa was lifted off and held demonstrating the underlying levator muscle. Muscle was freed up from its attachments at the junction of the hard palate and swept down so that it will be approximated across the midline. The Z-plasties were then designed, so there would be opposing Z-plasties from the nasal mucosa compared to the oral mucosa. The nasal mucosa was sutured first using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl. Next, the muscle was reapproximated using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl with an attempt to overlap the muscle in the midline. In addition, the remnant of the uvula tissue was found and was sutured in such a place that it would add some extra bulk to the nasal surface of the palate. Following this, the oral layer of mucosa was repaired using an opposing Z-plasty compared to the nasal layer. This was also sutured in place using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl. The anterior and posterior open edges of the palatal were sewn together. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Suction of blood and mucus performed at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\nImmediate Complications:\nNone.\n\nDisposition:\nIn satisfactory condition to recovery.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
