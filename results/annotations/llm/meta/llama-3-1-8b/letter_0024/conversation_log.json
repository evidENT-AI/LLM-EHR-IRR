(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n\nRemember, you must follow these rules when generating JSON:\n1.

At this time, the patient states that her septal perforation bothers her as she feels that she has very dry air through her nose as well as occasional epistaxis.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nChief Complaint:\nSeptal irritation.\n\nHistory Of Present Illness:\nThe patient is a 39-year-old African-American female status post repair of septal deviation but unfortunately, ultimately ended with a large septal perforation. The patient has been using saline nasal wash 2-3 times daily, however, she states that she still has discomfort in her nose with a \"stretching\" like pressure. She says her nose is frequently dry and she occasionally has nosebleeds due to the dry nature of her nose. She has no other complaints at this time.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nGENERAL: This is a pleasant African-American female resting in the examination room chair in no apparent distress.   ENT: External auditory canals are clear. Tympanic membrane shows no perforation, is intact.   NOSE: The patient has a slightly deviated right septum. Septum has a large perforation in the anterior 2/3rd of the septum. This appears to be well healed. There is no sign of crusting in the nose.   ORAL CAVITY: No lesions or sores. Tonsils show no exudate or erythema.   NECK: No cervical lymphadenopathy.   VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse 77, respirations 18, blood pressure 130/73.\n\nAssessment And Plan:\nThe patient is a 40-year-old female with a past medical history of repair of deviated septum with complication of a septal perforation. At this time, the patient states that her septal perforation bothers her as she feels that she has very dry air through her nose as well as occasional epistaxis. At this time, I counseled the patient on the risks and benefits of surgery. She will consider surgery but at this time, would like to continue using the saline nasal wash as well as occasional Bactroban to the nose if there is occasional irritation or crusting, which she will apply with the edge of a Q-tip. We will see her back in 3 weeks and if the patient does not feel relieved from the Bactroban as well as saline nasal spray wash, we will consider setting the patient for surgery at that time.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
