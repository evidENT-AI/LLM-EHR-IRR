(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n\nRemember, you must follow these rules when generating JSON:\n1.

Nasal endoscopy.   4. Adenoidectomy.\n\nDescription Of Operations:\nThe patient was brought to the operating room, endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. Both sides of the patient's nose were then sprayed with Afrin. Ears were inspected then with the operating microscope. The anterior inferior quadrant myringotomy incisions were performed. Then, a modest amount of serous and a trace of mucoid material encountered that was evacuated. The middle ear mucosa looked remarkably clean. Armstrong tubes were inserted. Ciprodex drops were instilled. Ciprodex will be planned for two postoperative days as well. Nasal endoscopy was carried out, and evidence of acute purulent adenoiditis was evident in spite of the fact that clinically the patient has shown some modest improvement following cessation of all milk products. The adenoids were shaved back, flushed with curette through a traditional transoral route with thick purulent material emanating from the crypts, and representative cultures were taken. Additional adenoid tissue was shaved backwards with the RADenoid shaver. Electrocautery was used to establish hemostasis, and repeat nasal endoscopy accomplished. The patient still had residual evidence of inter choanal adenoid tissue, and video photos were taken. That remaining material was resected, guided by the nasal endoscope using the RADenoid shaver to remove the material and flush with the posterior nasopharynx. Electrocautery again used to establish hemostasis. Bleeding was trivial. Extensive irrigation accomplished. No additional bleeding was evident. The patient was awakened, extubated, taken to the recovery room in a stable condition. Discharge anticipated later in the day on Augmentin 400 mg twice daily, Lortab or Tylenol p.r.n. for pain. Office recheck would be anticipated if stable and doing well in approximately two weeks. Parents were instructed to call, however, regarding the outcome of the culture on Monday next week to ensure adequate antibiotic coverage before cessation of the antibiotic.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
