(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n\nRemember, you must follow these rules when generating JSON:\n1.

There was a scant amount of fluid in both middle ear clefts.\n\nDescription Of Procedure:\nThe patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position, and general mask anesthesia was established. The right ear was draped in normal sterile fashion. Cerumen was removed from the external canal. The extruding Santa Barbara T-tube was identified and atraumatically removed. A fresh Santa Barbara T-tube was atraumatically inserted and Ciloxan drops applied.     The attention was then directed to the left side where severe TM atelectasis was identified. With a mask anesthetic, the eardrum elevated. A radial incision was made in the inferior aspect of the tympanic membrane and middle ear fluid aspirated. A Santa Barbara T-tube was then inserted without difficulty and 5 drops Ciloxan solution applied. Anesthesia was then reversed and the patient taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
