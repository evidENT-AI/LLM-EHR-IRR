(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

I've noted the following key takeaways:\n\n1. **Qualifier usage**: The gold-standard annotation uses a range of qualifiers, including \"treatment\", \"diagnoses\", \"symptoms\", \"sign\", and others. I will make sure to use the most appropriate qualifier for each annotation.\n2. **Laterality**: Laterality is consistently annotated, even when it's \"NA\". I will make sure to include laterality in all annotations.\n3. **Presence**: Presence is annotated as \"Confirmed\", \"Negated\", or \"NA\". I will use these values consistently.\n4. **Primary_secondary**: This field is used to indicate whether the annotation is primary or secondary. I will use \"Primary\" or \"Secondary\" consistently.\n5. **Experienced**: This field indicates who experienced the symptom or condition. I will use \"patient\" or \"NA\" consistently.\n6. **Treatment_stage**: This field indicates the stage of treatment. I will use \"Pre-treatment\", \"Post-treatment\", or \"NA\" consistently.\n7. **SNOMED CT codes**: The gold-standard annotation includes SNOMED CT codes where possible. I will try to include these codes in my annotations, but use \"NA\" if I'm unsure or if no code is available.\n8. **Context**: The context field provides a clear and concise sentence or phrase that describes the annotation. I will make sure to include a clear and relevant context for each annotation.\n9. **Text**: The text field is a direct quote from the letter. I will make sure to use the exact wording from the letter in this field.\n\nI'm ready to apply these learnings to the next letter. Please provide the text of the next letter, and I'll create a new annotation JSON."

Request for cosmetic change in the external appearance of the nose.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnoses:\n1. Nasal obstruction secondary to deviated nasal septum.   2. Bilateral turbinate hypertrophy.\n\nProcedure:\nCosmetic rhinoplasty. Request for cosmetic change in the external appearance of the nose.\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral via endotracheal tube.\n\nIndications For Operation:\nThe patient is a 26-year-old white female with longstanding nasal obstruction. She also has concerns with regard to the external appearance of her nose and is requesting changes in the external appearance of her nose. From her functional standpoint, she has severe left-sided nasal septal deviation with compensatory inferior turbinate hypertrophy. From the aesthetic standpoint, the nose is over projected, lacks rotation, and has a large dorsal hump. First we are going to straighten the nasal septum and reduce the size of the turbinates and then we will also take down the hump, rotate the tip of the nose, and de-project the nasal tip. I explained to her the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications for postsurgical procedure. She had her questions asked and answered and requested that we proceed with surgery as outlined above.\n\nProcedure Details:\nThe patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position. The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. The face, head, and neck were sterilely prepped and draped. The nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion. Procedure began with a left hemitransfixion incision, which was brought down into the left intercartilaginous incision. Right intercartilaginous incision was also made and the dorsum of the nose was elevated in the submucoperichondrial and subperiosteal plane. Intact bilateral septomucoperichondrial flaps were elevated and a severe left-sided nasal septal deviation was corrected by detachment of the caudal nasal septum from the maxillary crest in a swinging door fashion and placing it back into the midline. Posterior vomerine spur was divided superiorly and inferiorly and a large spur was removed. Anterior and inferior one-third of each inferior turbinate was clamped, cut, and resected. The upper lateral cartilages were divided from their attachments to the dorsal nasal septum and the cartilaginous septum was lowered by approximately 2 mm. The bony hump of the nose was lowered with a straight osteotome by 4 mm. Fading medial osteotomies were carried out and lateral osteotomies were then created in order to narrow the bony width of the nose. The tip of the nose was then addressed via a retrograde dissection and removal of cephalic caudal semicircle cartilage medially at the tip. The caudal septum was shortened by 2 mm in an angle in order to enhance rotation. Medial crural footplates were reattached to the caudal nasal septum with a projection rotation control suture of #3-0 chromic. The upper lateral cartilages were rejoined to the dorsal septum with a #4-0 plain gut suture. No middle valves or bone grafts were necessary. Intact mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture and Doyle nasal splints were placed on either side of the nasal septum. The middle meatus was filled with Surgicel and Cortisporin otic and external Denver splint was applied with sterile tape and Mastisol. Excellent aesthetic and functional results were thus obtained and the patient was awakened in the operating room, taken to the recovery room in good condition.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
