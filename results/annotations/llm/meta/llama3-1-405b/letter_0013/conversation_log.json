(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

I've noted the following key takeaways:\n\n1. **Qualifier usage**: The gold-standard annotation uses a range of qualifiers, including \"treatment\", \"diagnoses\", \"symptoms\", \"sign\", and others. I will make sure to use the most appropriate qualifier for each annotation.\n2. **Laterality**: Laterality is consistently annotated, even when it's \"NA\". I will make sure to include laterality in all annotations.\n3. **Presence**: Presence is annotated as \"Confirmed\", \"Negated\", or \"NA\". I will use these values consistently.\n4. **Primary_secondary**: This field is used to indicate whether the annotation is primary or secondary. I will use this field consistently.\n5. **Experienced**: This field is used to indicate who experienced the symptom or condition. I will use this field consistently.\n6. **Treatment_stage**: This field is used to indicate the stage of treatment. I will use this field consistently.\n7. **Snomed_ct**: SNOMED CT codes are used to provide a standardized vocabulary for medical concepts.

Fiberoptic nasal laryngoscopy. Atrophic dry nasal mucosa. Epistaxis. Atrophic laryngeal changes secondary to inhaled steroid use.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis:\nEpistaxis and chronic dysphonia.\n\nPostoperative Diagnoses:\n1. Atrophic dry nasal mucosa.   2. Epistaxis.   3. Atrophic laryngeal changes secondary to inhaled steroid use.\n\nProcedure Performed:\n1. Cauterization of epistaxis, left nasal septum.   2. Fiberoptic nasal laryngoscopy.\n\nAnesthesia:\nNeo-Synephrine with lidocaine nasal spray.\n\nFindings:\n1. Atrophic dry cracked nasal mucosa.   2. Atrophic supraglottic and glottic changes likely secondary to inhaled steroids and recent endotracheal tube intubation.\n\nIndications:\nThe patient is a 37-year-old African-American female who was admitted to ABCD General Hospital with a left wrist abscess. The patient was taken to the operating room for incision and drainage. Postoperatively, the patient was placed on nasal cannula oxygen and developed subsequent epistaxis. Upon evaluating the patient, the patient complains of epistaxis from the left naris as well as some chronic dysphonia that had become exacerbated after surgery. The patient does report of having endotracheal tube intubation during anesthesia. The patient also gives a history of inhaled steroid use for her asthma.   The patient was extubated after surgery without difficulty, but continued to have some difficulty and the Department of Otolaryngology was asked to evaluate the patient regarding epistaxis and dysphonia.\n\nProcedure Details:\nAfter the procedure was described, the patient was placed in the seated position. The fiberoptic nasal laryngoscope was then inserted into the patient's left naris. The nasal mucosal membranes were dry and atrophic throughout. There was no evidence of any mass lesions. The nasal laryngoscope was then advanced towards the posterior aspect of the nasal cavity. There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, lesion, or obstruction. The nasolaryngoscopy continued to be advanced into the oropharynx and the vallecula and the base of the tongue were evaluated and were without evidence of mass lesion or ulceration.     The fiberoptic scope was further advanced and visualization of the larynx revealed some atrophic, dry, supraglottic, and glottic changes. There was no evidence of any local mass lesion, nodule, or ulcerations. There was no evidence of any erythema. Upon phonation, the vocal cords approximated completely and upon inspiration, the true vocal cords were abducted in a normal fashion and was symmetric. The airway was stable and patent throughout the entire examination. The nasal laryngoscope was then slowly withdrawn from the supraglottic region and the scope was further advanced into the oropharynx and nasopharynx. The eustachian tube was completely visualized and was patent without obstruction. The scope was then further removed without difficulty. The patient tolerated the procedure well and remained in stable condition.\n\nRecommendations And Plan:\nThe patient would benefit from Ocean nasal spray as well as bacitracin ointment applied to the anterior naris. At this time, we were unable to discontinue the patient's inhaled steroids that she is using for her asthma. If this becomes possible in the future, this may provide her some relief of her chronic dysphonia. The patient is to follow up with Department of Otolaryngology after discharge from the hospital for further evaluation of these problems.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
