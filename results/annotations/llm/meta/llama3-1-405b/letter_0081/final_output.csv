brownish fluid with foul odor,"a chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.",signs,left,confirmed,primary,patient,pre-treatment,35013009
erythema of the mucosa,"today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi",signs,,confirmed,primary,patient,pre-treatment,
bloody secretions,"today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.",signs,,confirmed,primary,patient,pre-treatment,66857006
dense consolidation of the entire lung,therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.,signs,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,
pockets of purulent material,"there were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.",signs,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,35013009
whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit,there was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.,signs,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,
abscess,"there seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.",signs,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,
large cavity,"the most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.",signs,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,
left thoracoscopy and left thoracotomy,"operative procedure: left thoracoscopy and left thoracotomy with declaudication and drainage of lung abscesses, and multiple biopsies of pleura and lung.",procedures,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,

antibiotics,the patient was started on antibiotics,treatments,,confirmed,primary,patient,pre-treatment,281789004
thoracoport,"the chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the thoracoport in place",treatments,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,
prolene sutures,suture ligatures of prolene were required.,treatments,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,257394003
tissue pledget,"when the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a ""tissue pledget"" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with prolene sutures.",treatments,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,469237001
foley catheter,"also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-french foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the foley catheter was removed.",treatments,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,
"thrombin, gelfoam and surgicel","also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, gelfoam and surgicel.",treatments,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,372045002
blake chest tubes,"then two #24 blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk.",treatments,left,confirmed,primary,patient,post-treatment,264957007
