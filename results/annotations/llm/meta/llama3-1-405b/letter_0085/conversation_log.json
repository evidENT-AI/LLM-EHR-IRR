(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

Left superficial nasal cauterization.\n\nDescription Of Operation:\nThe patient was brought to the operating room. Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The McIvor mouth gag was inserted and gently suspended. Afrin was instilled in both sides of the nose and allowed to take effect for a period of time. The hypertrophic tonsils were then removed by the suction and snare. Deeply cryptic changes as expected were evident. Bleeding was minimal and controlled with packing followed by electrocautery followed by extensive additional irrigation. An inspection of the nasopharynx confirmed that the adenoids were in fact hypertrophic rubbery cryptic and obstructive. They were shaved back, flushed with prevertebral fascia with curette. Hemostasis established with packing followed by electrocautery. In light of his history of recurring nosebleeds, both sides of the nose were carefully inspected. A nasal endoscope was used to identify the plexus of bleeding, which was predominantly on the left mid portion of the septum that was controlled with broad superficial cauterization using a suction cautery device. The bleeding was admittedly a bit of a annoyance. An additional control was established by infiltrating slowly with a 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine around the perimeter of the bleeding site and then cauterizing the bleeding site itself. No additional bleeding was then evident. The oropharynx was reinspected, clots removed, the patient was extubated, taken to the recovery room in stable condition. Discharge will be anticipated later in the day on Lortab plus amoxicillin plus Ponaris nose drops. Office recheck anticipated if stable and doing well in three to four weeks.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
