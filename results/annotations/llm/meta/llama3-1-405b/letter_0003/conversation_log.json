(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

    "content": "I've studied the gold-standard annotation and learned the deep structural components that contribute to it. I've noted the following key takeaways:\n\n1. **Qualifier usage**: The gold-standard annotation uses a range of qualifiers, including \"symptoms\", \"diagnoses\", \"treatment\", and \"sign\". I will make sure to use these qualifiers accurately and consistently in my future annotations.\n2. **Laterality**: The annotation includes laterality information for each label, even if it's \"NA\". I will ensure that I provide laterality information for each label, as it's crucial for understanding the context of the annotation.\n3. **Presence**: The annotation includes presence information for each label, which indicates whether the condition or symptom is present or absent. I will make sure to include presence information for each label, using the values \"Confirmed\", \"Negated\", or \"NA\" as appropriate.\n4. **Primary/Secondary**: The annotation includes primary/secondary information for each label, which indicates whether the condition or symptom is primary or secondary. I will ensure that I provide primary/secondary information for each label, using the values \"Primary\", \"Secondary\", or \"NA\" as appropriate.\n5. **Experiencer**: The annotation includes experiencer information for each label, which indicates who is experiencing the condition or symptom. I will make sure to include experiencer information for each label, using the values \"Patient\", \"Family\", or \"NA\" as appropriate.\n6. **Treatment Stage**: The annotation includes treatment stage information for each label, which indicates the stage of treatment for the condition or symptom. I will ensure that I provide treatment stage information for each label, using the values \"Pre-treatment\", \"Post-treatment\", or \"NA\" as appropriate.\n7. **SNOMED CT**: The annotation includes SNOMED CT codes for each label, which provide a standardized way of representing medical concepts. I will make sure to include SNOMED CT codes for each label, using the values provided in the annotation or \"NA\" if no code is available.\n\nI'm ready to apply these learnings to the next letter and create high-quality annotations. Please provide the next letter for annotation."

Next, the right tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis and, using the gold laser, the anterior tonsillar pillar incised and, with this laser, dissection carried from the superior pole to the inferior pole and removed off the tonsillar muscular bed. A similar procedure was performed on the contralateral tonsil. Following meticulous hemostasis, saline was used to irrigate and no further bleeding noted.
