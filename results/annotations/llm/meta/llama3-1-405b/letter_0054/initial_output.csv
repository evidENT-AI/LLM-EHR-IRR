mucoperichondrium elevated,mucoperichondrium was elevated from left side of the cartilaginous septum and mucoperiosteum was elevated from the ethmoid plate.,procedures,left,confirmed,primary,patient,,236599009
vomer and inferior tunnel created,"vomer and inferior tunnel was created at the floor of the left side of the nose to connect the anterior and inferior tunnels, which was rather difficult at the area of the vomerine spur, which was very sharp and touching the inferior turbinate.",procedures,left,confirmed,primary,patient,,236599009
caudal cartilaginous septum separated,"the caudal cartilaginous septum, which was lying crosswise, was separated from the main cartilage leaving approximately 1 cm strut.",procedures,,confirmed,primary,patient,,236599009
right side mucoperichondrium released,the right side mucoperichondrium was released from the cartilaginous septum as well as ethmoid plate and the maxillary crest area.,procedures,right,confirmed,primary,patient,,236599009
caudal cartilaginous strut sutured,the caudal cartilaginous strut was sutured to the columella with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut suture to bring it into the midline.,procedures,,confirmed,primary,patient,,236599009
cartilaginous septum sutured,"further back, the cartilaginous septum anterior to the ethmoid plate was deviated to the left side, so it was freed from the maxillary crest, nasal dorsum, from the ethmoid plate, and was sutured in the midline with a transfixion #4-0 plain catgut sutures.",procedures,,confirmed,primary,patient,,236599009
ethmoid plate partially removed,"further posteriorly, the ethmoid plate was deviated to the left side and portion of it was removed with jansen-middleton punch forceps.",procedures,left,confirmed,primary,patient,,236599009
maxillary crest removed,the main deviation was also caused by the vomerine crest and the maxillary crest and supramaxillary cartilaginous cartilage. this area was freed from the perichondrium on both sides. the maxillary crest was removed with a gouge.,procedures,,confirmed,primary,patient,,236599009
vomer partially removed,vomer was partially removed with a gouge and the rest of the vomer was displaced back into the midline.,procedures,,confirmed,primary,patient,,236599009
