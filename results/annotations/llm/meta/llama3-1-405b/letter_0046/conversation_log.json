(Medical Transcription Sample Report) The patient had tympanoplasty surgery for a traumatic perforation of the right ear about six weeks ago. Mom called because his other ear was bothering him. Earlier today, he said it was ringing and vibrating. Now he says it does not hurt. Mom wondered if she overreacted but I asked her to come on in to look at the boy's ears. He has had a cold but it has not been severe. There has been no ear discharge.     The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty. I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus. The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected. The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue. Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide. The patient has no medical allergies. Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens. I looked at this throat which looks clear. The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions. If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops. I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection. I plan to see the patient again later this spring.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"

Fullness in right base of the tongue and chronic right ear otalgia.   (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\nPreoperative Diagnoses:\n1. Fullness in right base of the tongue.   2. Chronic right ear otalgia.\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nPending pathology.\n\nProcedure Performed:\nMicrosuspension direct laryngoscopy with biopsy.\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral.\n\nIndication:\nThis is a 50-year-old female who presents to the office with a chief complaint of ear pain on the right side. Exact etiology of her ear pain had not been identified. A fiberoptic examination had been performed in the office. Upon examination, she was noted to have fullness in the right base of her tongue. She was counseled on the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery and consented to such.\n\nProcedure:\nAfter informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Operative Suite where she was placed in supine position. General endotracheal tube intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia. The patient was rotated 90 degrees away where a shoulder roll was placed. A tooth guard was then placed to protect the upper dentition. The Dedo laryngoscope was then inserted into the oral cavity. It was advanced on the right lateral pharyngeal wall until the epiglottis was brought into view. At this point, it was advanced underneath the epiglottis until the vocal cords were seen. At this point, it was suspended via the Lewy suspension arm from the Mayo stand. At this point, the Zeiss microscope with a 400 mm lens was brought into the surgical field. Inspection of the vocal cords underneath the microscope revealed them to be white and glistening without any mucosal abnormalities. It should be mentioned that the right vocal cord did appear to be slightly more hyperemic, however, there were no mucosal abnormalities identified. This was confirmed with a laryngeal probe as well as use of mirror evaluated in the subglottic portion as well as the ventricle. At this point, the scope was desuspended and the microscope was removed. The scope was withdrawn through the vallecular region. Inspection of the vallecula revealed a fullness on the right side with a papillomatous type growth that appeared very friable. Biopsies were obtained with straight-biting cup forceps. Once hemostasis was achieved, the scope was advanced into the piriform sinuses. Again in the right piriform sinus, there was noted to be studding along the right lateral wall of the piriform sinus. Again, biopsies were performed and once hemostasis was achieved, the scope was further withdrawn down the lateral pharyngeal wall. There were no mucosal abnormalities identified within the oropharynx. The scope was then completely removed and a bimanual examination was performed. No neck masses were identified. At this point, the procedure was complete. The mouth guard was removed and the patient was returned to Anesthesia for awakening and taken to the recovery room without incident.\n\n\nRespond only with the JSON object following the specified format.\n"
