681bc85aa8eceb0329bd1abb,We inspected the ear canal,"We inspected the ear canal, identified the huge defect, which was completely filled with cerumen.

681bc8fda8eceb0329bd1abd,We prepped and draped the ear in a sterile fashion.,We prepped and draped the ear in a sterile fashion. We reopened the previously used postauricular incision and dissected down the mastoid cortex. We reflected the soft tissues anteriorly to the level of the ear canal and identified where the ear canal skin entered the defect in the mastoid bone. A #6 cutting bur was used to drill down the mastoid cortex and identified this cholesteatoma which was then carefully dissected out.,Procedures,Left,N/A,N/A,Patient,N/A,5820,50445001,28766
681bc917a8eceb0329bd1abf,finished a complete mastoidectomy,"We went all the way to the mastoid antrum. We finished a complete mastoidectomy with identification of the tegmen, sigmoid sinus. We removed the lateral aspect of the mastoid tip.",Procedures,Left,N/A,N/A,Patient,N/A,7747,,0

681bcd28a8eceb0329bd1ac5,"There was no cholesteatoma within the middle ear space, but there was roughly 40% surface area perforation","he remaining portion of the tympanic membrane was extremely calcified and myringosclerotic; this was removed. There was also a large focus of tympanosclerosis between the stapes crura, which was impinging the ability of the stapes to move. We carefully dissected this out",Procedures,Left,N/A,N/A,Patient,N/A,63952,60442001;15978951000119105;35100001,35384
681bcd9aa8eceb0329bd1ac7,there was a near total perforation,"here was only a minimal amount of anterior remnant of the drum left. We tried to go ahead and harvest the temporalis fascia, but there was really only wisps of this fascia in place. He had already had a previous tympanoplasty, but even outside the areas where the graft was taken, the temporalis muscle was quite atrophied and lumpy, and I suspect this was due to his chronic disease and long history of corticosteroid usage. We harvested a few pieces as best as we could.",Procedures,Left,N/A,N/A,Patient,N/A,6468,,0
681bce01a8eceb0329bd1ac9,We went ahead and did a meatoplasty,We went ahead and did a meatoplasty by making a canal incision in the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions. We excised cartilage posteriorly and inferiorly to enlarge the meatus.,Procedures,Left,N/A,N/A,Patient,N/A,4817,172608009,10427
681bce13a8eceb0329bd1acb,We excised cartilage posteriorly and inferiorly to enlarge the meatus,This cartilage was thin and used for cartilage tympanoplasty. We placed some Gelfoam in the middle ear space and placed the cartilage on the top of it.,Procedures,Left,N/A,N/A,Patient,N/A,5152,1290296002,51101
681bce48a8eceb0329bd1acd,This cartilage was thin and used for cartilage tympanoplasty,"We placed some Gelfoam in the middle ear space and placed the cartilage on the top of it. We did cut a titanium-PORP of the proper side and placed on top of the stapes capitulum to interface with the cartilage cap. A few other small pieces of temporalis fascia were used to bulge through the surrounding edges of the cartilage and make sure that it was medial to any remnant of ear canal and tympanic membrane remnants. We placed a layer of Gelfoam lateral to the graft, closed the postauricular incision in layers and put 2 Merocel packs in the ear. Glasscock dressing was applied.",Procedures,Left,N/A,N/A,Patient,N/A,5048,,0
681bce55a8eceb0329bd1acf,The patient was awakened,The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.
